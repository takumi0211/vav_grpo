# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final. Channel must be included for every message.<|end|><|start|>developer<|message|># Instructions

You are an optimisation agent that supervises a thermal energy storage (TES) plant. Your job is to minimise cumulative CO₂ emissions over the full simulation horizon by planning TES charge and discharge decisions.
Developer instructions: respond using ASCII characters only. Return a single line formatted exactly as `[action_index]`, where action_index is an integer in {0, 1, 2, 3}. Do not include additional text, explanations, markdown, or keys.

<|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Objective:
- Minimise total CO₂ emissions = electricity consumption × time-varying CO₂ intensity over the horizon.

Current context:
- Current time [h]: 2025-05-19 08:00:00
- Current TES energy [kWh]: 150

Forecast data:
Forecast features (raw values aligned with the RL look-ahead):

- Remaining business hours today (08:00-17:00, close at 18:00):
  - 08:00: load=27.7 kW, co2=0.390 kg-CO2/kWh  ←Now!!!
  - 09:00: load=23.9 kW, co2=0.379 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 10:00: load=26.1 kW, co2=0.376 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 11:00: load=32.4 kW, co2=0.382 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 12:00: load=24.9 kW, co2=0.405 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 13:00: load=24.9 kW, co2=0.407 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 14:00: load=28.6 kW, co2=0.409 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 15:00: load=31.7 kW, co2=0.415 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 16:00: load=21.0 kW, co2=0.421 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 17:00: load=30.0 kW, co2=0.418 kg-CO2/kWh

- Next-day planning metrics (for terminal planning):
  - load_mean=34.8 kW (average cooling demand for next day)
  - co2_low5_avg=0.220 kg-CO2/kWh (average of lowest 5 hours of CO2 factor for next day)
  - co2_min=0.209 kg-CO2/kWh (minimum CO2 factor for next day)

System parameters:
ASHP rated capacity [kW]: 100.0
ASHP base COP [-]: 4.0
TES capacity [kWh]: 300.0

Action space for the next hour:
0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Always maintain TES capacity between minimum and maximum bounds (0 < capacity < 300); violating these constraints incurs a large penalty.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.
- Consider next-day information when making decisions.

Return format:
- Output a single token formatted as `[action_index]` (e.g., `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`).<|end|><|start|>assistant",0,-8.28442379458212,-8.299701572359897,-8.319146016804343,-8.338590461248787,0.388420231354374,0.28615461266526115,0.19395833725494885,0.1314668187254161

0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Always maintain TES capacity between minimum and maximum bounds (0 < capacity < 300); violating these constraints incurs a large penalty.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.
- Consider next-day information when making decisions.

You are an optimisation agent that supervises a thermal energy storage (TES) plant. Your job is to minimise cumulative CO₂ emissions over the full simulation horizon by planning TES charge and discharge decisions.
Developer instructions: respond using ASCII characters only. Return a single line formatted exactly as `[action_index]`, where action_index is an integer in {0, 1, 2, 3}. Do not include additional text, explanations, markdown, or keys.

<|end|><|start|>user<|message|>Objective:
- Minimise total CO₂ emissions = electricity consumption × time-varying CO₂ intensity over the horizon.

Current context:
- Current time [h]: 2025-05-20 11:00:00
- Current TES energy [kWh]: 104

Forecast data:
Forecast features (raw values aligned with the RL look-ahead):

  - 15:00: load=37.4 kW, co2=0.301 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 16:00: load=32.3 kW, co2=0.350 kg-CO2/kWh
  - 17:00: load=35.6 kW, co2=0.385 kg-CO2/kWh

- Next-day planning metrics (for terminal planning):
  - load_mean=33.6 kW (average cooling demand for next day)
  - co2_low5_avg=0.290 kg-CO2/kWh (average of lowest 5 hours of CO2 factor for next day)
  - co2_min=0.275 kg-CO2/kWh (minimum CO2 factor for next day)

System parameters:
ASHP rated capacity [kW]: 100.0
ASHP base COP [-]: 4.0
TES capacity [kWh]: 300.0

Action space for the next hour:
0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Always maintain TES capacity between minimum and maximum bounds (0 < capacity < 300); violating these constraints incurs a large penalty.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.

System parameters:

Action space for the next hour:
0 → ASHP output ratio = 0.00 (ASHP off; rely on TES if demand exists)
1 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.33 (low output; TES covers most of the remaining demand)
2 → ASHP output ratio ≈ 0.67 (medium output; TES supplements when load exceeds this level)
3 → ASHP output ratio = 1.00 (full output; any surplus charges TES if capacity remains)

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Always maintain TES capacity between minimum and maximum bounds (0 < capacity < 300); violating these constraints incurs a large penalty.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.
- Consider next-day information when making decisions.

Operational notes:
- TES discharges automatically when load exceeds the scheduled ASHP output and energy is available.
- TES charges automatically when ASHP output exceeds the load and free capacity exists.
- Always maintain TES capacity between minimum and maximum bounds (0 < capacity < 300); violating these constraints incurs a large penalty.

Decision requirements:
- Optimise with a full-horizon perspective rather than a greedy step.
- Keep TES utilisation efficient; avoid unnecessary saturation or depletion.
- Prioritise emission reductions even if it requires near-term energy use.
- Consider pre-charging during low-carbon periods and discharging during high-carbon periods while respecting TES energy limits.
- Consider next-day information when making decisions.
