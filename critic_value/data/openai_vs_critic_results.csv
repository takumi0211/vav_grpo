0,,"1. Review zone temperatures: all zones at 26.1–26.3 °C, within 25–27 °C. Zone 2 (26.3 °C) is the warmest and needs slightly more cooling; the others are very close to target and gently trending downward or stable.  
2. Review CO₂ levels and trends: Zone 1 (970 ppm, +1.3 ppm/min), Zone 3 (954 ppm, +2.4 ppm/min) are rising but will remain under 1000 ppm over the next 5 min even with a small reduction in outdoor air. Zone 4 (828 ppm, +1.7 ppm/min) and Zone 2 (935 ppm, –0.5 ppm/min) are safely below. We can reduce the OA damper modestly to save fan and chiller power while keeping CO₂ ≤ 1000 ppm.  
3. Fan/pump power trade-off: pump power ∝ coil_valve³, fan power ∝ fan_speed³; increasing water flow is cheaper than boosting fan speed.  
4. Coil valve: to save pumping power, reduce chilled‐water valve from 0.689 to ~0.65. Temperatures will drift upward slightly but remain within 25–27 °C over 5 min.  
5. Fan speed/static reset: current zone dampers nearly wide open; one damper (Zone 3) at 1.0 fully open meets static reset. We can lower fan speed from 0.901 to ~0.86 to save fan power.  
6. Outdoor‐air damper: reduce from 0.3178 to 0.27 to cut cooling load and fan work, while CO₂ in all zones will stay ≤ 1000 ppm next interval.  
7. Zone dampers: shift a bit more flow to Zone 2 (the warmest) and back off on Zone 1 and Zone 4, leaving Zone 3 fully open to satisfy static‐pressure reset:  
   • Zone 1: 0.8988 → 0.88 (slightly less flow)

   • Zone 3: 0.9995 → 1.00 (static reset)

1,,"1. Comfort evaluation: All zones at 26.1–26.3°C, within the 25–27°C band. Trends are slightly downward or flat, so we can reduce cooling slightly without breaching comfort.
2. CO2/ventilation: Current CO2 levels (828–970ppm) and trends (+1.3 to +2.4ppm/min) project to at most ~976ppm in Zone 1 and ~966ppm in Zone 3 after 5 min. Both remain under the 1000ppm limit, so we can afford a modest reduction in outdoor air intake while preserving a safety margin.
3. Fan vs. water‐side power: Since pump power scales cubically with water‐flow proxy (coil_valve) and fan power with fan_speed³, and water‐side cooling is cheaper for the same load, we lean on reducing fan_speed more aggressively but still reduce both for energy savings.
4. Static‐pressure reset: Ensure one damper fully open (Zone 3) and throttle back the others to lower SP requirements and fan power.
