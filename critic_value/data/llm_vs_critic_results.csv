0,,"1. Verify zone comfort: All zone temperatures are within 25‑27 °C and close to the target 26 °C. 2. Verify CO₂: All CO₂ levels are below 1000 ppm and trending modestly upward; they are far from the 1050 ppm hard limit, so we can afford a small reduction in outdoor‑air intake. 3. Static‑pressure reset: Zone 3 already has its damper near 1.0, satisfying the requirement of keeping at least one damper fully open. 4. Power minimisation strategy: Reduce fan speed (cubic scaling → significant power drop) and coil valve opening (water‑side power also cubic but cheaper). 5. Avoid abrupt changes: Limit changes to ≤0.02 for each actuator relative to the previous values. 6. Proposed adjustments: 
   • Zone 1 damper: 0.8988 → 0.89 (‑0.01)

1,,"All zone temperatures are within the 25‑27 °C band, with the highest being 26.3 °C in Zone 2. CO₂ levels are below 1000 ppm and nowhere near the 1050 ppm safety limit. To keep temperatures closer to the 26 °C target while minimising power, we should reduce the outdoor‑air intake (since outdoor air at 33.7 °C would raise zone temperatures). We also want to avoid a large fan‑speed increase because fan power scales cubically. Instead, we raise the coil valve to increase cooling (water‑side power also scales cubically but is cheaper than fan power for the same cooling effect). The damper settings remain essentially unchanged; Zone 3 is already at ~100 % open, satisfying the static‑pressure reset rule.

2,,"All zone temperatures are already within the comfort band (25–27 °C) and close to the 26 °C target. Zone 1 CO₂ is near 1000 ppm and will remain below the 1050 ppm limit for the next 5 minutes even with the current CO₂ generation rates. Therefore, we can safely reduce outdoor‑air intake and fan speed to cut power without violating comfort or CO₂ constraints. We keep zone 3 damper at 100 % open (currently 0.9995) to satisfy the static‑pressure reset rule. Other dampers remain near their current values to avoid abrupt changes. Reducing fan speed from 0.901 to 0.85 lowers fan cubic power. Lowering the coil valve to 0.68 slightly reduces pump power.

3,,"Step 1: Verify comfort constraints. All zone temperatures are already within 25–27 °C (26.1–26.3 °C). A slight reduction in fan speed (to 0.88) is unlikely to raise temperatures beyond the comfort band given the current cooling trend and the modest change in airflow. Step 2: CO₂ limits. Present CO₂ levels are below 1000 ppm for all zones. The CO₂ trends show a modest rise for zones 1, 3, 4 and a slight decrease for zone 2. Even with a modest OA reduction, the CO₂ increase should remain well below the 1000 ppm ceiling. Step 3: Outdoor‑air minimisation. Current OA damper is 0.3178. Reducing it to 0.30 lowers the heat load without jeopardising ventilation. Step 4: Coil valve adjustment. To compensate for the small fan‑speed drop and the slightly reduced OA, increase the coil valve to 0.72. This raises water‑side cooling capacity; the cubic pump‑power penalty is acceptable compared to the fan‑power saving. Step 5: Static‑pressure reset logic. Zone 3 damper is already at ~1.0 (0.9995). The other zone dampers are reduced only modestly (≈0.02–0.03) to stay close to full opening while keeping the static pressure low. Step 6: Avoid abrupt changes. All actuator adjustments are ≤ 0.03 from the previous setpoint, satisfying the smooth‑change rule. Step 7: Clip to bounds. All chosen values are within their respective bounds. The resulting setpoint combination balances comfort, ventilation, and power minimisation.","{
