Outdoor air is warmer than target (30.4 C), so bringing in more OA would increase load. 2) Objectives/trade-offs: Comfort penalty dominates versus energy at this level of deviation, so prioritize a fast pull-down while avoiding unnecessary OA and extreme fan power. 3) Strategy this interval (5 min): Increase cooling capacity via coil valve and airflow, keep OA at minimum to avoid adding heat and humidity load, and bias zone dampers toward the warmest zones to speed recovery. 4) Actuator choices: - Zone dampers: open most in Zone 4 (warmest), then Zone 1, Zone 2, then Zone 3 to allocate more flow where needed. - OA damper: hold at minimum (0.05) since CO2 is far below 1000 ppm. - Coil valve: set high (0.78) to drop supply air temperature and enable effective sensible cooling. - Fan speed: increase to 1.10 to deliver sufficient cold air without maxing out energy. 5) Expected outcome: Reverse current slight warming trend to a cooling trend, reduce zone temps toward the 25–27 C band within successive intervals while maintaining CO2 well below limits and avoiding extra OA load.

Choose to keep fan high for one more interval and save energy by slightly trimming only the most comfortable zone’s damper. 3) Ventilation/CO2: Outdoor air is hotter (31°C). CO2 is low (541-629 ppm) and rising ~9-11 ppm/min; staying at minimum OA avoids heat load while keeping CO2 safely below targets for this interval. 4) Actuation strategy: Keep coil at max (coldest supply) and fan near previous high setting to finish pulling zones into the comfort band, while slightly reducing Zone 2 damper (closest to setpoint) to bias cooling to Zones 1/3/4. 5) Expected outcome: Zones 1/3/4 close to or at ~27.0-27.4°C; Zone 2 around ~27.0°C; CO2 remains <700 ppm; energy slightly reduced via damper reallocation without compromising comfort."",

Step 2: Forecast 5-minute evolution. With modest cooling maintained, zones should drift closer to 26°C; CO2 remains beneath 1000 ppm without needing additional ventilation. Step 3: Energy trade-offs. Lower OA to minimum to reduce sensible load; slightly reduce fan speed to cut fan power (largest energy lever), and trim coil a bit to reduce chiller load, while rebalancing zone dampers toward warmer zones (Z4, Z1). Step 4: Set actuators within bounds. Prioritize Z4=1.0, keep Z1 high, slightly reduce Z2 and Z3. OA damper to minimum. Fan slightly down; coil slightly down to maintain gentle cooling.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Summary of state and goals:
- Comfort target 26C within 25-27C. CO2 target <1000 ppm. Minimize energy.
- Zone 1: 25.8C (slightly cool), CO2 993 ppm trending up (~+3.5 ppm over 5 min). Risk of crossing 1000 without action.
- Zone 2: 26.1C stable, CO2 906 ppm.
- Zone 3: 26.1C stable, CO2 953 ppm.
- Zone 4: 26.5C (warmest), CO2 874 ppm and falling (well ventilated). Outdoor 32.8C rising.
5-min forecasts if unchanged: Z1 temp ~25.85C, CO2 ~996.5 ppm; Z2/Z3 remain ~26.1C; Z4 ~26.5C.
Control strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Prioritize cooling Zone 4 toward 26C by reallocating supply air rather than raising fan speed to save energy.
- Maintain or slightly improve CO2 safety margin, especially for Zone 1, with minimal OA increase to avoid chiller load jump.
- Avoid overcooling Zones 1-3; keep fan power steady; modest coil adjustment to offset a slight OA rise and assist Z4 cooling.
Chosen adjustments:
- Zone dampers: increase Z4 to 0.90 to deliver more cooling; slightly trim Z2 to 0.55 and Z3 to 0.62 to redistribute flow; keep Z1 at 0.80 to preserve ventilation for its near-limit CO2 while not increasing cooling too much.
- OA damper: small increase from 0.40 to 0.42 to add CO2 margin with limited energy impact given hot outdoor air.
- Coil valve: modest increase from 0.51 to 0.53 to maintain supply air temperature with the added OA and support Z4 cooling.
- Fan speed: hold at 0.78 to minimize fan energy; damper redistribution handles zone needs.
Expected outcomes over next 5 min:
- Zone 4 temperature should trend down modestly (~0.1-0.2C), moving toward 26C.
- Zones 2 and 3 remain near 26.1C; minor warming acceptable and within band.
- Zone 1 stays near 25.8-26.0C; CO2 remains below 1000 ppm with a slightly improved margin.

Outdoor is hot (33.3 C, rising), so avoid unnecessary outdoor air increases to limit cooling load.
Assessment by zone:
- Zone 1: 25.8 C (slightly cool), CO2 991 ppm trending down; keep ventilation steady to avoid CO2 creeping above 1000 while allowing a slight warm-up.
- Zone 2: 26.1 C stable, CO2 907 ppm stable; can trim airflow modestly to save energy without CO2 risk.
- Zone 3: 26.1 C and warming slightly; CO2 955 ppm and rising; needs a bit more supply air to improve cooling and ventilation margin.
- Zone 4: 26.5 C warmest; CO2 low and falling; increase airflow to correct temperature.
Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Keep OA damper at current level to maintain CO2 control without adding heat load (outdoor is very hot).
- Keep coil valve and fan speed steady to avoid overcooling cooler zones and extra energy; use zone dampers for targeted adjustments.
- Adjust dampers: increase Zone 3 and 4 for cooling/CO2; slightly trim Zone 2; hold Zone 1 to preserve CO2 margin.
Expected outcome: all zones stay within comfort band with Zone 3 and 4 drifting closer to 26 C; CO2 remains below 1000 ppm (Zone 1 trending flat/down, Zone 3 stabilized).

Comfort penalty is stronger than power penalty, so avoid letting Zone 4 approach 27C while not boosting energy unnecessarily. 2) Current state: Z1=26.1C, Z2=26.3C, Z3=26.4C, Z4=26.7C. All are drifting up about +0.01C/min (~+0.05C in 5 min). Without changes, Z4 would reach ~26.75C (still inside band but trending toward upper limit). CO2: Z1=988 ppm (near 1000, but trending down −2.5 ppm/min), others are 910, 943, 841, all decreasing. Outdoor is hot (34.6C, rising), so reducing OA saves coil load and helps supply air temperature. 3) Strategy for next 5 minutes: - Cooling capacity: Keep coil roughly steady; lowering OA fraction will reduce mixed-air temp and ease coil load, likely improving effective cooling without increasing valve. - Ventilation/CO2: Since all CO2 trends are negative and Z1 is close to 1000, reduce OA only moderately to avoid reversing the trend in Z1. Maintain relatively high Z1 damper to keep local ventilation. - Airflow distribution: Prioritize Z4 (warmest) at max damper to counter its upward drift; keep Z3 moderately high; keep Z2 modest; keep Z1 high for CO2 control but slightly below fully open to save some airflow. - Fan speed: Hold steady to preserve ventilation and cooling distribution while OA is reduced; this avoids risking CO2 rebound in Z1 and avoids undercooling Z4. 4) Chosen setpoints: - Zone dampers: [Z1 0.95 (CO2 near 1000), Z2 0.70 (slightly warm), Z3 0.85 (warmer), Z4 1.00 (warmest)]. - OA damper: 0.40 (down from 0.50) to cut outdoor heat load while keeping CO2 trends likely negative. - Coil valve: 0.62 (hold) leveraging cooler mixed air from lower OA, preventing Z4 drift to 27C. - Fan speed: 0.75 (hold) to maintain airflow/ventilation stability. 5) Bounds check: All values within provided limits. 6) Expected outcome over 5 minutes: Z4 trend should flatten or slightly cool due to max damper and reduced mixed-air temp; other zones remain near 26–26.4C.

Zone 4 is hottest at 26.7°C and still drifting up; Zones 2–3 at 26.4°C; Zone 1 near setpoint at 26.1°C. Slight additional cooling is beneficial, especially for Zone 4, without overshooting. 2) CO2 status: Zone 1 at 996 ppm trending up (~+6–7 ppm over 5 minutes), near the 1000 ppm target but far from the 1100 ppm violation. Other zones are below 1000 ppm. Keep CO2 under control without large energy increases. 3) Outdoor is hot (34°C), so increasing OA would raise cooling load.

Other zones are below 1000 ppm. Keep CO2 under control without large energy increases. 3) Outdoor is hot (34°C), so increasing OA would raise cooling load.

1) Comfort: Zones 2–4 are 0.4–0.6 C above the 26 C setpoint; Zone 1 is near target. We’ll modestly increase delivered cooling to hotter zones while preventing Zone 1 from overcooling.
2) CO2: All zones are below 1000 ppm and trending down. We can reduce outdoor air to cut heat load, but keep enough ventilation to avoid reversing CO2 trends.
3) Energy: Reduce fan speed (biggest cubic power saver) and lower OA fraction to reduce chiller load from hot outdoor air. Slightly increase coil valve to keep or improve comfort despite lower airflow.
4) Zone balancing: Open dampers further for hotter zones (2–4), trim the cooler zone (1) slightly to prioritize capacity.
5) Actions selected (within bounds):
- Lower OA damper from 0.45 to 0.35 to reduce heat load while keeping CO2 comfortably under 1000 ppm.
- Lower fan speed from 0.80 to 0.75 for energy savings; compensate with a small coil increase.
- Nudge coil valve from 0.82 to 0.84 to maintain/boost sensible cooling with reduced airflow.
- Zone dampers: Z1 slightly down to avoid overcooling; Z2 up; Z3 stays max; Z4 up to max to pull zones toward 26 C.
Expected outcome over 5 minutes: Slight temperature reductions in Zones 2–4 toward 26 C; Zone 1 stable near setpoint. CO2 remains below 1000 ppm with slower decline.

We can reduce outdoor air to cut heat load, but keep enough ventilation to avoid reversing CO2 trends.\n3) Energy: Reduce fan speed (biggest cubic power saver) and lower OA fraction to reduce chiller load from hot outdoor air. Slightly increase coil valve to keep or improve comfort despite lower airflow.\n4) Zone balancing: Open dampers further for hotter zones (2–4), trim the cooler zone (1) slightly to prioritize capacity.\n5) Actions selected (within bounds):\n- Lower OA damper from 0.45 to 0.35 to reduce heat load while keeping CO2 comfortably under 1000 ppm.\n- Lower fan speed from 0.80 to 0.75 for energy savings; compensate with a small coil increase.\n- Nudge coil valve from 0.82 to 0.84 to maintain/boost sensible cooling with reduced airflow.\n- Zone dampers: Z1 slightly down to avoid overcooling; Z2 up; Z3 stays max; Z4 up to max to pull zones toward 26 C.\nExpected outcome over 5 minutes: Slight temperature reductions in Zones 2–4 toward 26 C; Zone 1 stable near setpoint.

Outdoor air is very hot at 35.1°C, so extra ventilation increases cooling load. CO2: Z1=1018 ppm rising (+0.5/min), Z2=999 rising (+0.6/min), Z3=986 rising (+0.8/min), Z4=856 rising (+1.2/min).

- Comfort status: All zones within 25–27 C; Zones 2–4 are slightly warm (26.2–26.3 C) but trending flat/slightly down. Zone 1 is at 25.9 C (fine).
- CO2 status: Zone 1 at 999 ppm and rising (~+0.7 ppm/min) likely to exceed 1000 ppm in 5 min; others remain below 1000 ppm with small rises. Avoiding a CO2 penalty and future violation is priority.
- Outdoor air: Very hot (35.3 C, rising). Increasing OA raises cooling load, so compensate with coil capacity rather than increasing fan speed to limit fan energy.
- Control strategy for next 5 min: Increase OA fraction modestly to boost ventilation, keep fan speed steady to limit fan power, and drive coil to max to maintain supply air temperature and prevent zones 2–4 from warming due to higher OA. Keep zone dampers unchanged to maintain current thermal balance and ensure Zone 1 continues receiving maximum flow.
- Expected effects: OA↑ increases ventilation ~21% (0.33→0.40), stabilizing/reducing Zone 1 CO2 below 1000 ppm. Coil at 1.0 should hold supply temperature despite warmer mixed air. Fan at 0.95 limits energy use. Comfort should remain near 26 C.
- Next interval plan: If Zone 1 CO2 remains >1000 ppm, consider a small fan increase or further OA increase; if zones warm, reassess coil/fan tradeoff or slightly open dampers for warm zones.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.92, 0.95, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.95}","{

2) CO2 status: Z1=983 ppm (flat), Z3=980 ppm (slightly rising), Z2=946 ppm (falling), Z4=834 ppm (falling). Closest to 1000 ppm are Z1 and Z3, but both remain below target with mild trends.
3) Outdoor conditions: Very hot (35.6°C) and rising; additional outdoor air would increase cooling load significantly.
4) Strategy to maximize reward over next 5 min: Maintain CO2 below target without increasing OA fraction; slightly rebalance zone airflow toward Z3; keep cooling capacity steady to avoid drift upward in Zone 3; take only a minimal fan reduction to save power without risking CO2 or temperature drift.

- Keep OA damper at 0.35 to avoid CO2 rise near the 1000 ppm threshold while outdoor temperature is high.
- Keep coil valve at 0.80 to hold sensible capacity given rising outdoor temperature and Zone 3 being warm.

Outdoor air is very hot (35.6C), so economizer cooling is not beneficial; minimize OA while keeping CO2 safe. Zone 3 and 4 are the warmest (26.5C, 26.4C); Zone 3 CO2 is near 1000 ppm and slightly rising. Actions: (1) Rebalance VAV dampers to shift airflow toward Zones 3 and 4, slightly reduce Zones 1 and 2.

Expected outcome: Zone 1 and 3 CO2 stay under 1000 ppm, temperatures remain near 26 C, and energy use is contained."",

All zones are within the 25-27 C band and near the 26 C center: Z1=25.9 (-0.1), Z2=26.2 (+0.2), Z3=26.2 (+0.2), Z4=26.2 (+0.2). Temperature trends are flat to slightly cooling, so no aggressive changes needed.
Step 2: Assess CO2. Z1=997 ppm and rising at +1.6 ppm/min; in 5 minutes it would hit ~1005 ppm, slightly above the 1000 ppm target (well below 1100 violation). Z2=984, Z3=967, Z4=834 and stable. To avoid CO2 penalties, especially in Z1, modestly increase ventilation to Z1 and slightly increase OA fraction.
Step 3: Consider outdoor conditions and energy. Outdoor is hot at 34 C; increasing OA significantly would raise cooling load. Prefer targeted increase in Z1 damper with only a small OA bump. Keep fan speed steady to avoid cubic fan energy increase. Slight coil increase can offset the small extra OA load and pull 26.2 C zones a touch closer to 26 C.
Step 4: Decide adjustments for the 5-minute horizon. - Increase Z1 damper to boost its ventilation and cooling slightly. - Keep Z2 and Z3 dampers unchanged (already high, temps marginally warm). - Trim Z4 damper slightly (low CO2, modestly warm) to reduce system flow/energy while not risking CO2; coil cooling increase counters any small warming. - Bump OA damper minimally to flatten Z1 CO2 trend without large energy cost. - Nudge coil valve up slightly to maintain temps given the small OA increase. - Keep fan speed unchanged to minimize energy.
Step 5: Expected outcomes. Z1 CO2 trend should flatten or reverse, keeping it ~<1000 ppm. Zone temperatures should hold near 26 C or drift slightly closer with the small coil increase. Energy impact is minimal (no fan increase, minor OA and coil adjustments). All actuators within bounds.

Zones: Z1=25.9C (-0.1C), CO2=996 ppm (very near limit, slight downward trend); Z2=26.2C (+0.2C), CO2=983 ppm; Z3=26.2C (+0.2C), CO2=965 ppm; Z4=26.2C (+0.2C), CO2=834 ppm. Temps are stable (~0.0 C/min). 3) Ventilation/CO2: Z1 is the limiting zone. To protect CO2 margin, avoid reducing OA damper and avoid reducing Z1 airflow. Keeping ventilation at least at current levels is prudent; slight redistribution should not starve Z1. 4) Comfort strategy: Three zones are 0.2C warm; address by slightly increasing their dampers to deliver more cool air. Keep Z1 damper unchanged to preserve its ventilation and let it drift up a tenth toward 26.0C (still comfortable). 5) Energy strategy: Outdoor is hot; avoid increasing OA. Keep fan speed steady to preserve ventilation and avoid CO2 risk. A small coil valve increase will nudge supply air cooler to pull 26.2C toward 26.0C without raising fan power. 6) Predicted short-term effects (5 min): Z2–Z4 should drift down by ~0.05–0.1C toward setpoint with higher local airflow and slightly colder coil; Z1 may stay ~25.9–26.0C. CO2: Z1 stays just below 1000 ppm (current trend slightly downward), others remain well below target.

Zones: Z1=25.9C (-0.1C), CO2=996 ppm (very near limit, slight downward trend); Z2=26.2C (+0.2C), CO2=983 ppm; Z3=26.2C (+0.2C), CO2=965 ppm; Z4=26.2C (+0.2C), CO2=834 ppm. Temps are stable (~0.0 C/min). 3) Ventilation/CO2: Z1 is the limiting zone. To protect CO2 margin, avoid reducing OA damper and avoid reducing Z1 airflow. Keeping ventilation at least at current levels is prudent; slight redistribution should not starve Z1. 4) Comfort strategy: Three zones are 0.2C warm; address by slightly increasing their dampers to deliver more cool air. Keep Z1 damper unchanged to preserve its ventilation and let it drift up a tenth toward 26.0C (still comfortable). 5) Energy strategy: Outdoor is hot; avoid increasing OA. Keep fan speed steady to preserve ventilation and avoid CO2 risk. A small coil valve increase will nudge supply air cooler to pull 26.2C toward 26.0C without raising fan power. 6) Predicted short-term effects (5 min): Z2–Z4 should drift down by ~0.05–0.1C toward setpoint with higher local airflow and slightly colder coil; Z1 may stay ~25.9–26.0C. CO2: Z1 stays just below 1000 ppm (current trend slightly downward), others remain well below target.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and constraints: Keep zone temps near 26C (25-27C band), CO2 <1000 ppm, and minimize energy (fan/chiller/pump). We must respect actuator bounds.
2) Current state summary:
- Outdoor 34C (hot); avoid unnecessary OA to reduce cooling load.
- Zone temps: Z1=25.9 (-0.1C), Z2=26.2 (+0.2C), Z3=26.2 (+0.2C), Z4=26.3 (+0.3C). All stable (~0 delta/min).
- CO2: Z1=994 (very near 1000) trending down (-0.5 ppm/min), Z2=981, Z3=963, Z4=831; all trending down slightly.
- Previous actuators: zone dampers [0.85, 0.88, 0.86, 0.58], OA=0.36, coil=0.74, fan=0.70.
3) Reward implications:
- Comfort penalties (weight 2.0) dominate over power (weight 0.2), so preserve/Improve comfort first.
- CO2 penalties start above 1000 ppm; strong violation at 1100. Z1 is borderline; avoid reductions in ventilation that risk pushing it above 1000.
4) Control strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Keep fan speed at 0.70 to avoid reducing total ventilation (protect Z1 CO2 margin) and stabilize thermal delivery.
- Keep OA damper at 0.36: CO2 is already trending down; increasing OA in 34C outdoor air would raise coil load. Decreasing OA risks Z1 crossing 1000. Hold steady.
- Coil valve: hold at 0.74 to maintain current supply air temperature. Zones 2-4 are slightly warm; reducing coil would worsen comfort. Given comfort’s higher weight, prioritize tightening temps around 26C over small chiller savings.
- Zone-level balancing via dampers:
  • Z1 (25.9C, CO2=994): slightly increase damper to improve its ventilation and nudge CO2 further below 1000, while coil unchanged should limit additional overcooling. Small change to avoid dropping temp too low.
  • Z2, Z3 (26.2C): slightly increase dampers to provide a touch more cooling to pull them toward 26C without changing coil.
  • Z4 (26.3C): modest damper increase to trim temp toward 26C; its CO2 is low so added ventilation is acceptable.
5) Expected short-term outcome (5 min):
- Z1 CO2 should drift further below 1000; temperature should remain within band near 26C. Z2-Z4 temps should tick down a few tenths toward 26C; CO2 remains below 1000. Energy use roughly unchanged (fan/coil held), avoiding comfort/CO2 penalties while marginally improving comfort alignment.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Step 1: Assess current state and objectives.
- Comfort target: 26C with acceptable band 25-27C. All zones are within band: Z1=26.0, Z2=26.5, Z3=26.3, Z4=26.3. Slightly warm in Z2/Z3/Z4 but acceptable.
- IAQ target: CO2 < 1000 ppm; Z1=998 ppm (borderline), Z2=994, Z3=946, Z4=805. Current trends slightly negative, indicating adequate ventilation at prior settings.
- Energy: Prior settings are moderately high (fan 0.7, coil 0.77, OA 0.4). Outdoor 33.1C is hot; excess OA raises cooling load. Fan energy is significant; aim for modest reductions without risking CO2 spike.

Step 2: Identify risks and priorities for 5-minute horizon.
- Highest risk: Z1 CO2 just below 1000; avoid crossing target and far from violation 1100. Keep ventilation to Z1 strong.
- Thermal risk is low; temps are stable and within band. Small adjustments should not push any zone beyond 27C in 5 minutes, especially with prioritized airflow to Z1/Z2.

Step 3: Control strategy for reward maximization.
- Maintain OA fraction near current to protect CO2 margin in Z1; reduce fan modestly to cut energy while keeping total OA flow close to prior.
- Slightly reduce coil valve (small energy saving) but keep enough cooling to nudge Z2 toward 26C.
- Reallocate zone dampers to prioritize Z1 (IAQ) and Z2 (warmest); trim Z3/Z4 to save airflow and energy.

Step 4: Proposed setpoints and rationale.
- Zone dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 0.6, 0.55]
  • Z1 to 1.0 for maximum ventilation/cooling due to borderline CO2.
  • Z2 to 1.0 to gently cool from 26.5C toward 26C.
  • Z3 and Z4 reduced to 0.6 and 0.55; both are within comfort and have good CO2 margin.
- OA damper: 0.40 (unchanged) to avoid sudden drop in ventilation given Z1=998 ppm.
- Fan speed: 0.65 (from 0.7) to reduce fan energy with only ~7% reduction in total flow; with OA held, OA flow reduction is modest, keeping CO2 stable.
- Coil valve: 0.76 (slightly below 0.77) to maintain cooling with slightly reduced airflow; should prevent temps from drifting up while saving a bit of chiller energy.

Step 5: Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes.
- CO2: Z1 should remain ~stable or slightly decreasing; other zones remain safely below 1000 ppm.
- Temperature: Z2 should drift slightly down; Z3/Z4 may increase minimally but remain well within 25-27C.
- Energy: Reduced fan speed and marginal coil reduction cut power without IAQ/comfort penalties.

Step 6: Contingency for next interval.
- If Z1 CO2 rises toward >1005 ppm, increase OA to 0.45 or fan to 0.68 while keeping Z1 damper at 1.0.
- If Z2 temp >26.7C, either raise coil to ~0.80 or return fan to ~0.68 while keeping Z2 damper high.
- If Z3/Z4 begin approaching 27C, restore their dampers by +0.05 to +0.1.

All within 25-27 C; Z1 risks further cooling below center, others slightly above target but stable. 2) CO2 vs 1000 ppm: Z1=991 (decreasing ~-2 ppm over 5 min), Z2=946 (+1), Z3=944 (+2), Z4=813 (flat).

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Summary of reasoning and plan for the next 5 minutes:
- Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C band. Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.8°C) and drifting down slowly; Zones 2–4 are 26.1°C and stable. To reduce energy while staying in-band, slightly reduce cooling capacity.
- CO2: Zone 1 is at 990 ppm and trending down (-0.1 ppm/min). Others are <950 ppm with mild positive trends. Outdoor air is hot (32.1°C), so we want to lower OA fraction to cut cooling load, but keep enough ventilation to avoid crossing 1000 ppm—particularly for Zone 1. The safest trade-off is a modest OA reduction while holding fan speed steady.
- Energy: Biggest savings come from reducing outside air load and coil valve. Keeping fan near current level maintains ventilation robustness while we watch CO2 in Zone 1. Slight redistribution of zone dampers reduces flow to zones that are slightly warm but stable, and keeps or slightly boosts Zone 1 to hedge CO2.
- Chosen adjustments: (1) Reduce coil valve from 0.56 to 0.50 to soften cooling, allowing temps to drift toward 26°C. (2) Reduce OA damper from 0.35 to 0.30 to cut OA load without risking CO2 spike; keep fan at 0.60 for stable ventilation. (3) Slightly increase Zone 1 damper to 0.80 for local ventilation support; trim Zones 2–4 dampers modestly to save airflow/energy while keeping comfort.
- Expected outcome in 5 min: Zone temperatures remain within 25–27°C, likely nearer to 26–26.2°C for Zones 2–4 and ~25.8–26.0°C for Zone 1. CO2 should remain below 1000 ppm in all zones, with Zone 1 staying near or slightly below current value. Energy use decreases via reduced OA load and coil valve.
- Bounds: All outputs clipped to provided limits.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.66, 0.6, 0.58], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.6}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Assess conditions: All zones are within the 25–27°C band. Z1 is slightly cool (25.7°C). Z2–Z4 are slightly warm (26.2°C). CO2 is highest in Z1 at 994 ppm and rising at ~2.1 ppm/min; in 5 minutes it would exceed 1000 ppm if we do nothing. Outdoor air is hot (31.3°C), so extra OA raises cooling load. 2) Reward implications: Crossing 1000 ppm increases CO2 penalty (weight 0.5), so preventing Z1 from exceeding 1000 ppm is valuable. Energy weight (0.2) is lower, so a modest increase in ventilation/cooling is justified. Comfort is already good; maintain near 26°C. 3) Strategy for next 5 minutes: - Increase OA fraction to reduce supply air CO2. - Slightly increase fan to raise total ventilation. - Bias zone airflow toward Z1 to boost dilution locally while trimming lower-priority zones slightly. - Nudge coil valve up to offset the warmer mixed air from higher OA and keep Z2–Z4 near 26°C, while keeping Z1 within band. 4) Chosen adjustments: OA damper to 0.40; fan speed to 0.56 (small increment to limit energy); coil valve to 0.34; zone dampers: increase Z1 to 0.66, slightly trim Z2–Z4 to 0.53/0.51/0.44. 5) Expected outcomes over 5 minutes: Z1 CO2 trend flattens or reverses, keeping peak below 1000 ppm; Z2–Z4 temperatures remain ~26.0–26.2°C; Z1 stays within comfort band.

Slight coil increase offsets added OA heat and trims the slight overheating in Zones 2–4. 4) Actions chosen: Increase OA damper from 0.40→0.50 to boost fresh air; keep fan at 0.52 to save power; increase coil valve 0.32→0.34 to hold temps near setpoint despite warmer OA; open Zone 1 damper to 0.64 to deliver more ventilation and dilution; slightly open Zone 2 and 3 dampers (0.68) to reduce their slight overheating; small increase for Zone 4 (0.54) to avoid starving it. 5) Expected 5-min outcome: Zone 1 CO2 trend reverses and drops below 1000 ppm, avoiding penalties; Zones 2–4 cool modestly toward ~26.1–26.2°C; Zone 1 temperature remains near 25.8–26.0°C. 6) Bounds check: All commands lie within provided limits; no clipping required."",
