Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C with acceptable band 25–27°C.
- All zones are hot:
  • Zone 1: 28.8°C (2.8°C above setpoint)
  • Zone 2: 28.7°C (2.7°C above)
  • Zone 3: 28.6°C (2.6°C above)
  • Zone 4: 28.9°C (2.9°C above)
- Temperature trend currently very mild warming: +0.01°C/min, i.e. +0.05°C over next 5 minutes if we did nothing.
- CO2 is low (~420 ppm) with flat trend in all zones; far below the 1000 ppm target and 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Outdoor air is 30.4°C, warmer than desired zone temperatures, so outdoor air does not help cooling; it is mainly for ventilation.

2) Assess previous action:
- zone_dampers: [0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05] (minimum)
- oa_damper: 0.05 (minimum)
- coil_valve: 0.06 (minimum)
- fan_speed: 0.45 (minimum)
These are essentially minimum-flow, minimum-cooling settings. Given all zones are ~2.6–2.9°C above setpoint and trending up slightly, minimum operation will continue to violate comfort and incur large comfort penalties.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Priority now is to reduce strong overheating quickly, because:
  • Comfort penalty is large (errors of ~+2.7°C across all zones are likely very costly).
  • Power weight is moderate (0.2), so using more power is acceptable when comfort is very poor.
  • CO2 is not a constraint yet; we can keep outdoor air at minimum to avoid adding heat load.
- We need more cold air and more airflow to the zones:
  • Increase cooling capacity (coil_valve) significantly.
  • Increase fan_speed to distribute cooling effectively.
  • Open zone dampers to allow more supply air into each zone.
- Because all four zones are similarly hot and within a narrow temperature range, we can treat them uniformly and avoid complex differential control at this moment.

4) Balancing speed vs energy:
- If we immediately set coil_valve and fan_speed to maximum (1.0 and 1.4), we would cool fastest but incur high power cost. With only a 5-minute horizon and large temp errors, moderately aggressive but not absolute-max settings tend to give a better reward tradeoff: strong comfort improvement with somewhat less energy.
- Target: aim to start pulling zone temperatures down toward the comfort band within the next couple of intervals; they are nearly 3°C high, so reaching band in just 5 minutes is unlikely regardless. That suggests a fairly strong but not maximum response.

5) Outdoor air damper decision:
- CO2 is ~420 ppm, flat trend; we can safely stay at minimum OA for now.
- Increasing OA would bring in 30.4°C air, raising cooling load; that’s counterproductive while we are trying to reduce high temperatures.
- So keep oa_damper at minimum bound (0.05).

6) Concrete actuator choices (within bounds):
Bounds:
- zone_dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
- oa_damper: [0.05, 0.6]
- coil_valve: [0.06, 1.0]
- fan_speed: [0.45, 1.4]

Decisions:
- Zone dampers: Increase substantially but not to full 1.0 to balance comfort vs energy. Opening to around 0.8 will greatly increase flow and cooling delivery versus 0.05 while still slightly moderating fan power implications.
  • Set all zones to 0.8 because they all need strong cooling and are similarly overheated.

- Coil valve: The zones are almost 3°C over setpoint and outdoor is warm, so supply air must be quite cold. Use high cooling capacity, e.g. 0.9 (close to max), to provide strong temperature pull-down.

- Fan speed: Raise significantly from 0.45 to improve heat removal but keep slightly below max to reduce energy vs 1.4. A value around 1.1 offers substantially more airflow while saving some power compared to maximum.

- OA damper: Keep at minimum 0.05 for energy and thermal reasons, since CO2 is very low.

7) Check bounds and clip:
- zone_dampers = 0.8 → within [0.05, 1.0]
- oa_damper = 0.05 → at lower bound [0.05, 0.6]
- coil_valve = 0.9 → within [0.06, 1.0]
- fan_speed = 1.1 → within [0.45, 1.4]
All values satisfy actuator limits.

8) Expected impact for next 5 minutes:
- Strongly increased cooling and airflow should reverse the current slight warming trend and begin to pull space temperatures downward, moving toward the 25–27°C band and sharply improving comfort_reward.
- OA remains low, so CO2 will rise only slowly from a low base and remain far below penalty thresholds in this short horizon.
- Energy use will increase, but given the initial severe comfort violation and relatively modest power weight, this aggressive correction is likely to improve the overall reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.9, ""fan_speed"": 1.1}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- All zones are significantly above the 26°C comfort center and outside the 25–27°C comfort band:
  • Zone 1: 28.5°C (error +2.5°C), cooling at -0.06°C/min → in 5 min ≈ -0.3°C → ~28.2°C
  • Zone 2: 28.4°C (error +2.4°C), -0.08°C/min → -0.4°C → ~28.0°C
  • Zone 3: 28.4°C, -0.06°C/min → -0.3°C → ~28.1°C
  • Zone 4: 28.7°C, -0.05°C/min → -0.25°C → ~28.45°C
- Even with current strong cooling (coil 0.9, fan 1.1, zone dampers 0.8), all zones will remain ~1.8–2.5°C above setpoint after 5 minutes, still clearly outside comfort band.
- CO2 levels are low and trending upward but far below the 1000 ppm target and 1100 ppm violation:
  • Zone 1: 505 ppm, +15.5 ppm/min → ~582 ppm in 5 min
  • Zone 2: 456 ppm, +7.7 ppm/min → ~495 ppm
  • Zone 3: 472 ppm, +10.4 ppm/min → ~524 ppm
  • Zone 4: 461 ppm, +8.6 ppm/min → ~504 ppm
  So CO2 is not a constraint in this interval; we can keep OA near minimum to save energy.
- Outdoor air temperature is 30.7°C and rising (trend +3.6°C/hour), significantly hotter than the indoor target, so economizer cooling is not beneficial.

2) Reward tradeoffs this interval:
- Comfort_penalty term will be large if we stay hot; improving cooling reduces band_penalty and thus increases reward.
- Power_weight is 0.2, meaning energy is important but secondary to severe comfort deviations of ~2–3°C.
- CO2_penalty_weight is 0.5 but CO2 is so low that changes in OA damper will have negligible impact on reward this interval.
- Given large positive temperature errors and still-rising outdoor temperature, for the next 5 minutes it is rational to prioritize faster pull-down even if energy increases somewhat, because we remain far outside the comfort band.

3) Actuator strategy reasoning:
- Coil valve: Currently 0.9 with all zones still hot and only slowly cooling. Increasing to max (1.0) modestly increases chiller load but will improve SAT and help pull spaces toward comfort. With the comfort error so large and short interval, going to 1.0 is justified.
- Fan speed: Currently 1.1 (in range 0.45–1.4). Higher fan speed increases cooling delivery (more airflow through coil and to zones) but also fan power. Given all zones are hot with only modest cooling rate, a slight increase above 1.1 is beneficial. However, going straight to 1.4 may be overkill; 1.2–1.25 is a reasonable compromise to enhance cooling while respecting energy cost. I choose 1.2 to bump capacity but not max out energy.
- Zone dampers: All are at 0.8. Since all four zones are similarly hot and above comfort, there is no need to reallocate air—uniformly increasing slightly closer to max will enhance zone cooling. Raising all from 0.8 to 0.9 will increase VAV flow and zone cooling while not fully saturating at 1.0 (leaving some headroom and controlling fan power). Since power_weight is non-trivial, I avoid 1.0 this interval.
- OA damper: Currently at minimum 0.05 with low CO2. Raising OA would add heat load (outdoor 30.7°C) and fan energy for almost no CO2 benefit (targets far from 1000 ppm). Best to keep it at minimum 0.05, which is also the lower bound.

4) Check bounds and clip:
- zone_dampers target: [0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9] → within [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper target: 0.05 → within [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve target: 1.0 → within [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed target: 1.2 → within [0.45, 1.4]. No clipping required.

5) Expected outcome:
- Increased coil and modestly increased fan plus slightly more open zone dampers should raise cooling rates in all zones, improving comfort trajectories and moving closer to the 25–27°C band in subsequent intervals.
- Keeping OA at minimum preserves low energy usage and avoids adding heat, while CO2 will remain well below thresholds. Overall this choice should improve comfort_reward significantly with a tolerable rise in power_kw term.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.9, 0.9, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 1.2}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state and objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.
- All zones are too warm:
  * Z1: 28.2°C, error +2.2°C, cooling rate ≈ -0.07°C/min.
  * Z2: 27.9°C, error +1.9°C, cooling rate ≈ -0.09°C/min.
  * Z3: 28.0°C, error +2.0°C, cooling rate ≈ -0.07°C/min.
  * Z4: 28.4°C, error +2.4°C, cooling rate ≈ -0.07°C/min.
- Over 5 minutes at current rates, temperatures would drop only ~0.35–0.45°C, leaving all zones still >27.4°C (outside comfort band). We need strong cooling.
- CO2 is low in all zones (≈500–575 ppm) and rising slowly (~8–13 ppm/min). Over 5 minutes, each zone increases only ~40–65 ppm → all remain well below 700 ppm and far below the 1000 ppm target. CO2 penalties are negligible; no need to increase outdoor air beyond minimum.
- Outdoor air is hot (31°C) and rising; bringing in more OA increases cooling load and energy usage.
- Previous action: zone dampers 0.9, OA damper 0.05 (minimum), coil valve 1.0 (max cooling), fan 1.2 (high but not max). Temperatures are still high, so aggressive cooling must continue.

2) Control strategy for the next 5 minutes:
- Coil valve: keep at 1.0 (max). Zones are significantly above setpoint and trending down only modestly, so throttling cooling would harm comfort and reward more than it saves energy.
- Zone dampers: all zones are similarly too hot and cooling at similar rates, with Z4 hottest. To maximize cooling and keep control simple/robust over this short horizon, keep or slightly increase airflow to max. Since bounds allow up to 1.0 and we were at 0.9, move all to 1.0. This avoids starving any zone and should increase cooling capacity per zone.
- Fan speed: currently 1.2 with coil at 1.0 and dampers at 0.9; temps are still high. Increasing fan to near-max (1.3–1.4) increases airflow and sensible cooling to zones. Trade-off: more fan power vs better comfort. Given large temp errors (~+2°C) and tight comfort penalty, improving comfort is more valuable than the modest incremental fan energy for 5 minutes. Choose 1.35 (near max 1.4) to get a bump in cooling while slightly moderating energy vs full 1.4.
- OA damper: keep at minimum 0.05. CO2 is far below 1000 ppm and rising slowly, so more OA yields negligible CO2 reward gains but higher chiller and fan energy. Outdoor air is hotter than indoors, so extra OA is detrimental for cooling.

3) Safety and bounds check:
- Zone dampers: propose 1.0 for all; bounds [0.05, 1.0] → valid.
- OA damper: propose 0.05; bounds [0.05, 0.6] → minimum, valid.
- Coil valve: propose 1.0; bounds [0.06, 1.0] → max, valid.
- Fan speed: propose 1.35; bounds [0.45, 1.4] → within, valid.

4) Expected outcome next 5 minutes:
- Increased airflow and max coil should increase cooling rate vs current ~0.07–0.09°C/min, moving zones closer to or into the 25–27°C comfort band, thereby improving comfort reward more than the modest additional energy penalty.
- CO2 will continue to rise slightly but stay far below 1000 ppm; no CO2 penalties or violations are expected.

Thus, the following action balances strong cooling for comfort with reasonable energy use and maintains minimum OA.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 1.35}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and temperature trends:
- All zones are above the 26°C comfort center and slightly above the top of the comfort band (27°C max):
  • Z1: 27.7°C, error +1.7°C, cooling at -0.09°C/min → ≈ -0.45°C over 5 min → forecast ≈ 27.25°C (still above 26, barely within band by end of interval).
  • Z2: 27.4°C, error +1.4°C, -0.10°C/min → ≈ -0.50°C → forecast ≈ 26.9°C.
  • Z3: 27.6°C, error +1.6°C, -0.08°C/min → ≈ -0.40°C → forecast ≈ 27.2°C.
  • Z4: 28.0°C, error +2.0°C, -0.08°C/min → ≈ -0.40°C → forecast ≈ 27.6°C.
- With previous max cooling (all dampers 1.0, coil 1.0, fan 1.35), temps are dropping but zones, especially 3 and 4, will likely remain slightly above 27°C at the end of this 5‑minute interval.
- Given the narrow comfort sigma (0.25) and explicit penalty for being out of band, we should maintain strong cooling to pull all zones into/near the 25‑27°C band, especially Zone 4.

2) CO₂ status and trend:
- Current CO₂ (ppm) and 5‑min projections assuming trend persists:
  • Z1: 629 + 10.6*5 ≈ 682 ppm
  • Z2: 542 + 9.0*5 ≈ 587 ppm
  • Z3: 573 + 9.7*5 ≈ 622 ppm
  • Z4: 553 + 9.2*5 ≈ 599 ppm
- All are far below the 1000 ppm target and well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold. Even with small inaccuracies, ventilation is clearly adequate. This means we can keep outdoor air damper at or near minimum to reduce load and fan/pump/chiller energy without CO₂ penalty risk in the next 5 minutes.

3) Energy vs comfort trade‑off:
- Prior action: zone dampers all 1.0, coil 1.0, fan 1.35 (near maximum 1.4). This is aggressive and energy‑intensive.
- However, zones are still slightly too warm, and outdoor is hotter (31°C), so economizer cooling is not beneficial; we primarily rely on mechanical cooling.
- Power term (weight 0.2) pushes to reduce fan and coil a bit once temperatures approach the band, but under‑cooling would leave zones clearly outside comfort and incur comfort_penalty * band_penalty, which is typically larger than a modest reduction in power.
- Strategy for this single 5‑minute step: maintain strong cooling but trim slightly from the previous very aggressive settings, leveraging current downward temp trend. We keep good airflow in all zones to avoid creating lag in the warmest ones.

4) Per‑actuator reasoning:
- Zone dampers (0.05–1.0):
  • All zones are above setpoint and not yet comfortably within band, with Z4 the warmest and Z1/Z3 also high.
  • Reducing any zone damper now risks slowing cooling and keeping zones out of band; any large reduction would likely hurt comfort reward more than it helps power.
  • Keep all zone dampers at 1.0 to maximize delivery of cold air to each VAV box, allowing us to modulate energy primarily via coil and fan.

- OA damper (0.05–0.6):
  • Outdoor air at 31°C is significantly warmer than indoor zones (~27–28°C). More OA increases sensible load and fan energy without a CO₂ benefit (CO₂ well below 1000 ppm).
  • To minimize energy and maintain CO₂ safety, keep OA damper at the minimum 0.05.

- Coil valve (0.06–1.0):
  • Last step was at 1.0 with temps still a bit high; cooling is needed.
  • If we hold at 1.0, we ensure strong cooling; if we drop too much, zones will likely remain above 27°C and hurt comfort.
  • Given all zones remain ~1–2°C above setpoint and outdoor is hot, slightly reducing coil while maintaining strong fan airflow should still move zones into/near band but save some chiller energy.
  • Choose a modest reduction to 0.9 — still high cooling, but with some energy savings relative to 1.0.

- Fan speed (0.45–1.4):
  • Previously 1.35, near maximum. Fan power scales roughly with cube of speed, so even a small reduction gives meaningful energy savings.
  • We need to keep enough flow to deliver cooling and maintain good mixing. With all VAV dampers open and coil still strong, we can drop fan slightly while preserving cooling.
  • A reduction from 1.35 to 1.2 retains high airflow but saves noticeable energy, likely without significantly harming cooling over 5 minutes.

5) Safety and bounds check:
- Zone dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] → within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.05 → within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.9 → within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 1.2 → within [0.45, 1.4].

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures continue to decline, likely bringing Zones 1–3 solidly into/near the 25–27°C band and pulling Zone 4 closer to or just inside the upper band limit.
- CO₂ remains comfortably under 1000 ppm, avoiding penalties.
- Power is reduced relative to the previous interval by trimming fan and coil slightly, improving the reward while prioritizing comfort.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.9, ""fan_speed"": 1.2}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C (band 25–27°C).
- All zones are slightly too warm but already cooling down:
  • Zone 1: 27.4°C, error +1.4, cooling at -0.07°C/min → in 5 min ≈ 27.4 - 0.07*5 = 27.05°C (just inside upper comfort limit).
  • Zone 2: 27.0°C, error +1.0, -0.09°C/min → ≈ 27.0 - 0.09*5 = 26.55°C (inside band, close to target).
  • Zone 3: 27.3°C, error +1.3, -0.07°C/min → ≈ 27.3 - 0.07*5 = 26.95°C (inside band).
  • Zone 4: 27.6°C, error +1.6, -0.07°C/min → ≈ 27.6 - 0.07*5 = 27.25°C (slightly above band if trend stayed exactly constant, but cooling rate will usually increase with higher load / more cooling, so some safety margin remains).
- Overall: zones are converging toward or into comfort band already with current strong cooling.

- CO2 levels (target <1000 ppm, violation at 1100 ppm):
  • Z1: 682 ppm, +10.3 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ 682 + 10.3*5 = 733 ppm.
  • Z2: 585 ppm, +8.7 ppm/min → ≈ 629 ppm.
  • Z3: 621 ppm, +9.4 ppm/min → ≈ 668 ppm.
  • Z4: 597 ppm, +8.9 ppm/min → ≈ 642 ppm.
- All are comfortably below 1000 ppm; even with modest OA we are far from violation. No need to increase OA for IAQ protection in this interval.

- Current actuators (previous action):
  • Zone dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] (max for all zones).
  • OA damper: 0.05 (minimum).
  • Coil valve: 0.9 (strong cooling).
  • Fan speed: 1.2 (high, near max 1.4).
- Energy use is high (fan at 1.2, coil at 0.9). Since comfort is nearing band center and CO2 is good, we can reduce energy while preserving comfort.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
Objectives: keep temps mostly within 25–27°C, CO2 <1000 ppm, while reducing power.
Key considerations:
- Outdoor air is 31°C (warmer than zones), so increasing OA would increase cooling load; we should keep OA at or near minimum (0.05) since CO2 is low.
- Coil and fan dominate energy: we can reduce both somewhat but must still cool, especially Zone 4 and Zone 1.
- Zone dampers at 1.0 give full flow; we could slightly reduce the best-performing zones while keeping more to the warmest, but this may add complexity without much benefit in 5 minutes. Since VAV fan power scales nonlinearly with flow, the global flow reduction is better handled via fan speed and coil rather than throttling some zones aggressively.

Given current cooling trends, even with some reduction in coil and fan, zones should remain in or very near the comfort band during the next 5 minutes because:
- They’re already within ~1.0–1.6°C above setpoint and trending down.
- The system was previously at high power, so we have headroom to back off slightly while still providing net cooling.

3) Specific actuator adjustments:
- Zone dampers:
  • Keep all at 1.0 this interval to avoid starving the slightly warm zones, especially Zone 4 and Zone 1, and to keep control simple while we lower global cooling power.
  • This ensures adequate airflow to all zones while we explore energy reduction via fan and coil.

- OA damper:
  • Keep at 0.05 (minimum). CO2 is low and far from target; additional OA would only increase load and risk overshooting cooling demand.

- Coil valve:
  • Reduce from 0.9 to a moderate-high level, e.g., 0.7.
  • Rationale: We still need cooling at 08:20 (early in day, outdoor 31°C), but full 0.9 may push some zones below 26°C in the near future and wastes chiller energy. 0.7 should maintain cooling, but at lower chiller power, and should still allow Zone 4 and Zone 1 to move toward the upper band boundary without overshooting cold.

- Fan speed:
  • Decrease from 1.2 to about 1.0.
  • This reduces fan energy significantly while still providing ample airflow with all dampers at 1.0 and coil at 0.7. Given current downward temperature trends and low CO2, 1.0 should be sufficient to avoid comfort or IAQ issues in the next 5 minutes.

4) Check against bounds:
- Zone dampers: proposed [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0] within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: proposed 0.05 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: proposed 0.7 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: proposed 1.0 within [0.45, 1.4].

5) Expected outcome for next interval:
- Temperatures should continue drifting down but at a slightly slower rate due to weaker coil and fan, likely keeping all zones near the upper-middle of the comfort band, minimizing comfort penalty.
- CO2 will rise modestly but remain well below 1000 ppm; no violation risk.
- Power usage will drop meaningfully (lower fan speed + lower coil valve), improving the reward trade-off.

Thus, the following setpoints balance comfort, IAQ, and energy for the upcoming 5-minute interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 1.0}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and temperature trends:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C with a center at 26°C.
- Current zone temps:
  • Zone 1: 27.1°C (0.1°C above band), cooling at -0.05°C/min → in 5 min ≈ 26.85°C (still above 26 but within 25–27 band).
  • Zone 2: 26.6°C, cooling at -0.07°C/min → in 5 min ≈ 26.25°C (near center).
  • Zone 3: 27.0°C, cooling at -0.05°C/min → in 5 min ≈ 26.75°C (within band).
  • Zone 4: 27.4°C, cooling at -0.05°C/min → in 5 min ≈ 27.15°C (slightly above upper band, still warmest zone).
- All zones are trending down with current aggressive settings (all dampers 1.0, coil 0.7, fan 1.0). We can likely reduce energy while still keeping temps in or near band.

2) CO2 status and trend:
- Current CO2:
  • Z1: 736 ppm, +10.4 ppm/min → 5 min ≈ 788 ppm.
  • Z2: 627 ppm, +8.3 ppm/min → ≈ 668 ppm.
  • Z3: 668 ppm, +9.2 ppm/min → ≈ 714 ppm.
  • Z4: 640 ppm, +8.6 ppm/min → ≈ 683 ppm.
- All well below 1000 ppm target and far from 1100 ppm violation. With OA damper at minimum (0.05), CO2 is rising but still comfortably below thresholds. No need to increase OA; we can stay at minimum to reduce load.

3) Outdoor conditions:
- Outdoor temperature: 31°C, hotter than zones. Increasing outdoor air would add sensible load and increase coil/fan energy.
- Since CO2 is safe, keep OA damper at minimum 0.05.

4) Energy vs comfort tradeoff:
- Current action: zone_dampers [1,1,1,1], OA 0.05, coil 0.7, fan 1.0.
- Zones are already above setpoint but moving down at a comfortable rate. We want to avoid overcooling below 25–26°C while cutting energy.
- The tight comfort sigma (0.25) implies strong penalty for being far from 26°C, but we’re currently on the warm side. Slightly slower cooling is acceptable as long as we don’t let zones drift too warm.

5) Strategy for this 5-minute interval:
- Zone dampers: All zones are a bit warm, with Zone 4 warmest. Instead of individual modulation (no separate bounds per zone provided, only a global min/max), we can:
  • Keep all dampers relatively high but not at 1.0 to reduce fan and reheat energy while still providing cooling.
  • Slight bias upwards is ideal for Zone 4, but we lack individual specific constraints beyond [0.05,1.0], so we choose a moderately high common value.
- Choose zone dampers ≈ 0.8 for all zones. This should still allow cooling but reduce airflow and energy vs 1.0.

- Coil valve:
  • With fan previously at 1.0 and coil at 0.7, we had moderate-strong cooling.
  • With reduced airflow (0.8 dampers, slightly lower fan) we can also reduce coil a bit to avoid overcooling while saving chiller energy.
  • Target coil around 0.6 to slightly reduce cooling intensity but still provide sufficient cooling to bring temps toward the band.

- Fan speed:
  • Range 0.45–1.4. Previously at 1.0.
  • Given all zones are above center and still warm-ish, we shouldn’t drop fan too aggressively; but we can modestly reduce it to save power while still delivering cooling.
  • Choose around 0.85: a moderate reduction that will decrease power significantly (since fan power is roughly cubic with speed) while maintaining good cooling.

- OA damper:
  • Leave at the minimum 0.05 to limit latent and sensible load since CO2 is safe.

6) Check constraints and expected impact:
- zone_dampers: 0.8 within [0.05,1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.05 within [0.05,0.6].
- coil_valve: 0.6 within [0.06,1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.85 within [0.45,1.4].
- Expected result over 5 minutes:
  • Cooling rate may slow somewhat vs previous interval but zones should still move toward or stay within the 25–27°C band, with less risk of overshoot to below 25°C.
  • CO2 remains well under 1000 ppm since interval is short and current growth rates are modest.
  • Fan and chiller power decrease, improving the energy term in the reward.

7) Final decision:
- Implement a moderate energy-saving step: reduce fan speed and coil valve, and moderately close zone dampers while keeping minimum OA.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.85}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs targets:
- Temperature target: 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps: Z1 27.0, Z2 26.4, Z3 26.8, Z4 27.3.
  • All zones are within band but Z1 and Z4 are at/above upper edge (Z4 slightly above band top), Z3 also a bit warm, Z2 near ideal.
- Temperature trends (°C/min): Z1 -0.03, Z2 -0.05, Z3 -0.04, Z4 -0.03.
  • Over next 5 minutes, projected deltas ≈ trend * 5:
    - Z1: -0.15 → 26.85°C
    - Z2: -0.25 → 26.15°C
    - Z3: -0.20 → 26.60°C
    - Z4: -0.15 → 27.15°C
  • Z4 likely to remain slightly above 27°C if we keep conditions identical; Z1 will still be a bit warm (but inside band). So we need slightly more cooling/airflow, with emphasis on Z4 and some on Z1/Z3.

- CO2 levels (ppm): Z1 791, Z2 667, Z3 713, Z4 682.
  • All are well below 1000 ppm target; trends are positive but modest: ~8–10 ppm/min.
  • Over 5 min, approximate increases:
    - Z1: +52.5 → ~844 ppm
    - Z2: +40.5 → ~708 ppm
    - Z3: +45.5 → ~758 ppm
    - Z4: +41.5 → ~724 ppm
  • Even with lower outdoor air, they will remain well below target and far from violation threshold (1100 ppm). So we can safely prioritize energy savings over extra ventilation this interval.

- Outdoor conditions: 31°C (hotter than indoor). Outdoor air is a cooling penalty (warmer air to cool) and an energy penalty for coil; we should not increase OA unless needed for CO2. Given CO2 is fine, we can keep OA minimum.

- Previous actions:
  • Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 0.8]
  • OA damper: 0.05 (minimum)
  • Coil valve: 0.6
  • Fan speed: 0.85

- Bounds:
  • Zone dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
  • OA damper: [0.05, 0.6]
  • Coil valve: [0.06, 1.0]
  • Fan speed: [0.45, 1.4]

2) Reward trade-offs:
Reward = comfort_reward - comfort_penalty * band_penalty - power_weight * power_kw - co2_penalty_weight * co2_penalty - co2_violation_penalty.
- Comfort is strongly weighted via comfort_penalty, and comfort_sigma is small (0.25°C), so deviations from 26°C are costly.
- However, current temps are only slightly high and already trending down. A large increase in cooling (coil/fan) would improve comfort marginally while increasing power. A modest adjustment toward more cooling in the warmest zones, without large fan/coil increases, should be near-optimal.
- CO2 is currently low; OA damper can remain at minimum to save energy.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Objectives for this short interval:
  • Bring Z4 down closer to ≤27°C, ideally trending it closer to 26–26.5°C.
  • Nudge Z1 and Z3 slightly cooler.
  • Avoid overcooling Z2, which is already close to 26°C and trending downward faster than others.
  • Conserve energy by avoiding high fan or coil settings; we can leverage zoning instead of global increases.

- Actuator-level reasoning:
  a) Outdoor air damper:
     • CO2 far from limit; OA adds sensible heat (31°C outdoor) and load on coil.
     • Keep OA at its minimum (0.05) to minimize energy and avoid warming the supply.

  b) Coil valve:
     • At 0.6 currently; zone temps are all within band and trending downward.
     • Because Z4 will be slightly above band if no changes are made, we can either: increase coil valve (colder air) or increase airflow to specific zones.
     • Increasing coil substantially (e.g., >0.7) risks overcooling Z2 and increases chiller energy.
     • A mild increase from 0.6 to about 0.65 provides a bit more cooling capacity without a big energy penalty; combined with targeted damper changes, this should bring Z4 nearer the band edge.

  c) Fan speed:
     • Currently 0.85, which is fairly high relative to the 0.45–1.4 range.
     • Increasing fan would increase cooling via more CFM but also increase fan power (generally ~cubic with speed) and push more air to all zones, likely overcooling Z2.
     • Since temps are already trending down, we can slightly reduce fan speed for energy savings while compensating with zoning and a small coil increase.
     • Dropping fan too much might slow cooling excessively in Z4; a small reduction (e.g., to 0.8) should maintain adequate cooling while saving some fan energy.

  d) Zone dampers:
     • Currently all at 0.8 (balanced distribution).
     • Z4 is warmest (27.3) and projected to remain slightly above band; allocate more airflow to Z4.
     • Z1 and Z3 are also warm but less so; keep them similar to or slightly above previous to maintain their downward trend.
     • Z2 is close to setpoint and cooling fastest; slightly reduce damper to avoid overcooling and to free capacity for Z4.
     • Since absolute CFM scaling also depends on fan speed, we’ll use relative shifts:
       - Z4: increase damper moderately from 0.8 to about 0.9.
       - Z1: keep at 0.8 (still needs some cooling but less critical than Z4).
       - Z3: perhaps slightly increase to 0.85 to help bring it closer to 26°C.
       - Z2: slightly reduce to 0.75 to temper its cooling rate.
     • This redistributes airflow where it’s most needed without a big fan-speed increase.

4) Check against constraints and clip:
- Zone dampers:
  • Z1: 0.8 → within [0.05, 1.0].
  • Z2: 0.75 → within bounds.
  • Z3: 0.85 → within bounds.
  • Z4: 0.9 → within bounds.
- OA damper: 0.05 (minimum), within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.65, within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.8, within [0.45, 1.4].

5) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Slightly colder supply air (coil 0.65) with a modest fan speed (0.8) and more airflow to Z4 (and a bit to Z3) should:
  • Bring Z4 closer to or slightly within the 25–27°C band, improving comfort and avoiding violation at next step.
  • Keep Z1 and Z3 trending downward comfortably within band.
  • Keep Z2 near 26°C, avoiding unnecessary overcooling by reducing its damper.
- OA remains at minimum, so CO2 will rise but remain well below 1000 ppm, keeping CO2 penalties negligible while reducing energy use associated with conditioning hot outdoor air.
- Overall, this action balances a small comfort improvement in warmer zones with modest energy savings (slightly reduced fan, controlled coil) to maximize reward for this interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.75, 0.85, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.65, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort / temperature assessment:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band: 25–27°C.
- Zone 1: 26.8°C, error +0.8, cooling down slowly (−0.03°C/min). Projected in 5 min: 26.65°C → still high side of band.
- Zone 2: 26.2°C, error +0.2, cooling at −0.04°C/min. Projected: ~26.0°C → nearly perfect.
- Zone 3: 26.6°C, error +0.6, cooling at −0.03°C/min. Projected: ~26.45°C → within band but slightly warm.
- Zone 4: 27.1°C, error +1.1, cooling at −0.03°C/min. Projected: ~26.95°C → still near upper edge, warmest/most critical.
- Outdoor is hot (31.7°C and rising), so any increase in OA significantly increases cooling load.
- Current coil_valve=0.65 and fan_speed=0.8 are delivering moderate cooling; zones are slowly approaching setpoint but not fast, and outdoor temperature is rising.

Conclusion: Maintain or slightly increase cooling capacity to pull Zone 4 more comfortably into band, but avoid overshooting others below 25°C. Given the slow cooling trends, risk of overcooling in 5 minutes is low.

2) CO₂ assessment:
- Zone 1: 843 ppm, +10 ppm/min → projected ~893 ppm.
- Zone 2: 706 ppm, +7.9 ppm/min → projected ~746 ppm.
- Zone 3: 758 ppm, +8.8 ppm/min → projected ~802 ppm.
- Zone 4: 724 ppm, +8.3 ppm/min → projected ~766 ppm.
All are comfortably below 1000 ppm target and well below 1100 ppm violation. CO₂ is rising, but there is ample headroom; no immediate need to increase outdoor air. Keeping OA low saves energy.

3) Energy considerations:
- Power is driven largely by fan_speed, coil_valve (chilled water/compressor), and OA fraction (ventilation and conditioning load).
- To maximize reward, we should only use as much cooling and airflow as needed to keep zones within or near comfort band and keep CO₂ safely below target.
- Given zones are slightly warm and trending slowly cooler, we can use a modest increase in cooling capacity with minimal additional energy, while holding OA damper at minimum.

4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- OA damper: Keep at minimum bound 0.05 since CO₂ is <900 ppm and trending to <900–800 ppm levels in 5 minutes; rising but far from 1000 ppm.
- Coil valve: Slightly increase from 0.65 to 0.7 to boost cooling capacity as outdoor temperature is high and rising. This should help Zone 4 get closer to mid-band without excessive energy increase.
- Fan speed: Keep at 0.8 (moderate). Increasing fan would raise energy more significantly; current zone cooling trends are acceptable with a bit more coil.

5) Zone damper adjustments:
Goal: Give relatively more cooling/airflow to warmer zones (especially Zone 4) while slightly reducing to the closer-to-setpoint zone(s) to avoid overcooling and reduce fan power indirectly (though VAV box damper change primarily affects distribution, not central fan energy directly here, but it does impact effective cooling).

Current dampers:
- Z1: 0.80 (26.8°C, slightly warm).
- Z2: 0.75 (26.2°C, nearly on setpoint and cooling fastest).
- Z3: 0.85 (26.6°C, moderately warm).
- Z4: 0.90 (27.1°C, warmest).

Planned tweaks:
- Slightly reduce Z2 damper because it is closest to setpoint and cooling faster, to avoid pushing it below 26 and to free capacity for others.
- Slightly reduce Z1, which is also a bit high but not as critical as Z4.
- Maintain or slightly increase Z3.
- Increase Z4 slightly to prioritize cooling there.

Concrete choices (small, conservative moves to avoid oscillation):
- Zone 1: from 0.80 → 0.78 (minor reduction, still high).
- Zone 2: from 0.75 → 0.70 (more reduction since it’s almost ideal and cooling fastest).
- Zone 3: from 0.85 → 0.87 (small increase).
- Zone 4: from 0.90 → 0.95 (push closer to max to cool the warmest zone).
All remain within [0.05, 1.0].

6) Bounds check:
- zone_dampers: [0.78, 0.70, 0.87, 0.95] ∈ [0.05, 1.0] → OK.
- oa_damper: 0.05 ∈ [0.05, 0.6] → at minimum bound → OK.
- coil_valve: 0.70 ∈ [0.06, 1.0] → OK.
- fan_speed: 0.80 ∈ [0.45, 1.4] → OK.

7) Expected outcome over the next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures: Slightly faster cooling due to higher coil, with more of the conditioned air directed to Zone 4 and Zone 3. Zone 4 should move closer to 26.7–26.8°C or better, reducing comfort penalty. Zone 2 should stay near 26°C despite slightly reduced damper because it is already close to target and has a favorable trend.
- CO₂: Will continue rising but should remain safely below 1000 ppm in all zones. With OA at minimum, we’re trading some future CO₂ headroom for energy savings, but we are still far from any penalty thresholds.
- Energy: Small increase in chiller/pump energy from coil_valve 0.65→0.70, no change to fan_speed, OA at minimum, so overall power increase is modest and justified by improved comfort.

This balance should maximize the given reward by improving comfort for the warmest zone, staying well within CO₂ limits, and keeping energy usage moderate.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.78, 0.7, 0.87, 0.95], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1) Comfort / temperature assessment:\n- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band: 25–27°C.\n- Zone 1: 26.8°C, error +0.8, cooling down slowly (−0.03°C/min). Projected in 5 min: 26.65°C → still high side of band.\n- Zone 2: 26.2°C, error +0.2, cooling at −0.04°C/min. Projected: ~26.0°C → nearly perfect.\n- Zone 3: 26.6°C, error +0.6, cooling at −0.03°C/min. Projected: ~26.45°C → within band but slightly warm.\n- Zone 4: 27.1°C, error +1.1, cooling at −0.03°C/min. Projected: ~26.95°C → still near upper edge, warmest/most critical.\n- Outdoor is hot (31.7°C and rising), so any increase in OA significantly increases cooling load.\n- Current coil_valve=0.65 and fan_speed=0.8 are delivering moderate cooling; zones are slowly approaching setpoint but not fast, and outdoor temperature is rising.\n\nConclusion: Maintain or slightly increase cooling capacity to pull Zone 4 more comfortably into band, but avoid overshooting others below 25°C. Given the slow cooling trends, risk of overcooling in 5 minutes is low.\n\n2) CO₂ assessment:\n- Zone 1: 843 ppm, +10 ppm/min → projected ~893 ppm.\n- Zone 2: 706 ppm, +7.9 ppm/min → projected ~746 ppm.\n- Zone 3: 758 ppm, +8.8 ppm/min → projected ~802 ppm.\n- Zone 4: 724 ppm, +8.3 ppm/min → projected ~766 ppm.\nAll are comfortably below 1000 ppm target and well below 1100 ppm violation. CO₂ is rising, but there is ample headroom; no immediate need to increase outdoor air. Keeping OA low saves energy.\n\n3) Energy considerations:\n- Power is driven largely by fan_speed, coil_valve (chilled water/compressor), and OA fraction (ventilation and conditioning load).\n- To maximize reward, we should only use as much cooling and airflow as needed to keep zones within or near comfort band and keep CO₂ safely below target.\n- Given zones are slightly warm and trending slowly cooler, we can use a modest increase in cooling capacity with minimal additional energy, while holding OA damper at minimum.\n\n4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:\n- OA damper: Keep at minimum bound 0.05 since CO₂ is <900 ppm and trending to <900–800 ppm levels in 5 minutes; rising but far from 1000 ppm.\n- Coil valve: Slightly increase from 0.65 to 0.7 to boost cooling capacity as outdoor temperature is high and rising. This should help Zone 4 get closer to mid-band without excessive energy increase.\n- Fan speed: Keep at 0.8 (moderate). Increasing fan would raise energy more significantly; current zone cooling trends are acceptable with a bit more coil.\n\n5) Zone damper adjustments:\nGoal: Give relatively more cooling/airflow to warmer zones (especially Zone 4) while slightly reducing to the closer-to-setpoint zone(s) to avoid overcooling and reduce fan power indirectly (though VAV box damper change primarily affects distribution, not central fan energy directly here, but it does impact effective cooling).\n\nCurrent dampers:\n- Z1: 0.80 (26.8°C, slightly warm).\n- Z2: 0.75 (26.2°C, nearly on setpoint and cooling fastest).\n- Z3: 0.85 (26.6°C, moderately warm).\n- Z4: 0.90 (27.1°C, warmest).\n\nPlanned tweaks:\n- Slightly reduce Z2 damper because it is closest to setpoint and cooling faster, to avoid pushing it below 26 and to free capacity for others.\n- Slightly reduce Z1, which is also a bit high but not as critical as Z4.\n- Maintain or slightly increase Z3.\n- Increase Z4 slightly to prioritize cooling there.\n\nConcrete choices (small, conservative moves to avoid oscillation):\n- Zone 1: from 0.80 → 0.78 (minor reduction, still high).\n- Zone 2: from 0.75 → 0.70 (more reduction since it’s almost ideal and cooling fastest).\n- Zone 3: from 0.85 → 0.87 (small increase).\n- Zone 4: from 0.90 → 0.95 (push closer to max to cool the warmest zone).\nAll remain within [0.05, 1.0].\n\n6) Bounds check:\n- zone_dampers: [0.78, 0.70, 0.87, 0.95] ∈ [0.05, 1.0] → OK.\n- oa_damper: 0.05 ∈ [0.05, 0.6] → at minimum bound → OK.\n- coil_valve: 0.70 ∈ [0.06, 1.0] → OK.\n- fan_speed: 0.80 ∈ [0.45, 1.4] → OK.\n\n7) Expected outcome over the next 5 minutes:\n- Temperatures: Slightly faster cooling due to higher coil, with more of the conditioned air directed to Zone 4 and Zone 3. Zone 4 should move closer to 26.7–26.8°C or better, reducing comfort penalty. Zone 2 should stay near 26°C despite slightly reduced damper because it is already close to target and has a favorable trend.\n- CO₂: Will continue rising but should remain safely below 1000 ppm in all zones. With OA at minimum, we’re trading some future CO₂ headroom for energy savings, but we are still far from any penalty thresholds.\n- Energy: Small increase in chiller/pump energy from coil_valve 0.65→0.70, no change to fan_speed, OA at minimum, so overall power increase is modest and justified by improved comfort.\n\nThis balance should maximize the given reward by improving comfort for the warmest zone, staying well within CO₂ limits, and keeping energy usage moderate."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and trends:
- Comfort band 25–27°C; center 26°C.
- Current temps: Z1 26.7 (slightly warm, within band), Z2 26.0 (perfect), Z3 26.5 (slightly warm, within band), Z4 27.0 (at warm limit).
- All temp_deltas are slightly negative (~ -0.02 to -0.03 °C/min), so zones are slowly cooling already. Over 5 minutes:
  • Z1: 26.7 + 5 * (-0.02) ≈ 26.6
  • Z2: 26.0 + 5 * (-0.03) ≈ 25.85
  • Z3: 26.5 + 5 * (-0.03) ≈ 26.35
  • Z4: 27.0 + 5 * (-0.03) ≈ 26.85
All stay inside 25–27°C with some margin. We don’t need more cooling; we mainly need to avoid Z4 drifting higher, but trend is already downward.

2) CO2 conditions and trend:
- Current CO2 and 5‑minute projections (assuming roughly linear using given deltas):
  • Z1: 892 + 5 * 9.4 ≈ 939 ppm
  • Z2: 745 + 5 * 7.7 ≈ 784 ppm
  • Z3: 801 + 5 * 8.6 ≈ 844 ppm
  • Z4: 765 + 5 * 8.2 ≈ 806 ppm
All remain below 1000 ppm and far from 1100 ppm violation threshold. CO2 is rising in all zones, indicating relatively low outdoor air presently (OA damper 0.05). Given we are still well below targets, we don’t need aggressive ventilation increases this interval; small increases would reduce future CO2 penalties but increase energy use via more outdoor load and higher fan power. Reward penalizes both average CO2 and power; given good margin, priority is to keep energy low and accept modest CO2 rise.

3) Outdoor conditions and system state:
- Outdoor 32.4°C and rising fast (trend +8.4°C/hour). So OA air is much warmer than indoor setpoint 26°C.
- Previous action: zone dampers [0.78, 0.7, 0.87, 0.95], OA damper 0.05, coil 0.7, fan 0.8.
  • Coil 0.7 and fan 0.8 are fairly high, giving noticeable cooling; this matches small negative temp trends despite high outdoor temperature.
  • OA damper is at minimum 0.05: this keeps cooling load and energy use lower at the cost of higher CO2 rise. Currently acceptable.

4) Reward tradeoffs:
- Comfort: currently good and trending slightly cooler; excessively increasing cooling (coil/fan) risks pushing some zones toward 25°C lower band in future intervals, incurring comfort penalty.
- Power: fan and coil energy penalized via power_weight 0.2. Reducing coil and fan where possible improves reward.
- CO2: target 1000 ppm, weight 0.5 plus violation penalty at 1100 ppm. We are comfortably below both and will remain so for this interval; a modest CO2 increase is cheaper than additional power for more OA or higher fan.

Given this, the best strategy for the next 5 minutes is a gentle energy reduction while maintaining comfort margins and avoiding too-rapid CO2 rise.

5) Zone damper strategy:
- All CO2 values are relatively similar (745–892 ppm) and none are critical; no single zone demands dominant airflow for CO2.
- Thermal: Z4 is warmest (27.0, going to ~26.85) and should maintain relatively higher airflow than others to ensure it cools adequately. Z1 is next warmest; Z2 is coolest, right at setpoint trending down; Z3 slightly warm but trending down appropriately.
- To reduce fan and coil load slightly without causing discomfort, modestly lower zone dampers in the more comfortable zones, keep Z4 relatively open, and avoid extreme changes that could distort flow distribution.
- Proposed adjustments from previous:
  • Zone 1: 0.78 → 0.75 (slight reduction; still high enough to maintain cooling and ventilation).
  • Zone 2: 0.7 → 0.65 (coolest zone; can accept a bit less air).
  • Zone 3: 0.87 → 0.8 (moderately warm but trending down; reduce slightly).
  • Zone 4: 0.95 → 0.9 (still the highest damper setting; very slight reduction just for some energy savings while still prioritizing this zone).
All remain well within [0.05, 1.0].

6) Outdoor air damper:
- Currently at minimum 0.05 with CO2 projections still below 1000 ppm, so no need to increase.
- Outdoor is much hotter than indoors; extra OA would significantly increase cooling load and potentially power.
- Maintain OA damper at 0.05 to minimize energy while keeping CO2 trajectory acceptable.

7) Coil valve strategy:
- Current coil 0.7 is giving mild net cooling (zone temps dropping slightly despite very hot outdoor air). We can reduce coil a bit to save chiller energy while still maintaining downward or at least flat temperature trends.
- If we drop coil too much, with hot OA and moderate fan, zones could start warming, especially Z4 at the upper limit; we want to keep Z4 clearly inside band.
- Modest reduction: 0.7 → 0.6. With only small reductions in zone dampers and fan (see below), this should still provide enough cooling to keep all zones within 25–27°C during the next 5 minutes, especially given current negative temp trends and short horizon.

8) Fan speed strategy:
- Current fan speed 0.8. Fan power usually scales superlinearly with speed, so reducing speed yields notable savings.
- However, lowering fan too much reduces airflow, affecting both cooling delivery and CO2 control. Given we also reduced some zone dampers and coil, we should make only a modest fan reduction to avoid flattening or reversing the cooling trend.
- Proposed: 0.8 → 0.7. This should reduce energy while still maintaining sufficient airflow for comfort and ventilation at this early time of day.

9) Bounds and final check:
- Zone dampers within [0.05, 1.0]: [0.75, 0.65, 0.8, 0.9] all valid.
- OA damper within [0.05, 0.6]: keep at 0.05.
- Coil valve within [0.06, 1.0]: 0.6 valid.
- Fan speed within [0.45, 1.4]: 0.7 valid.

This action sequence reduces coil and fan energy moderately, keeps OA at minimum to avoid high outdoor load (while CO2 remains below target and far from violation), and maintains slightly higher airflow to the warmest zone (Z4). This should maximize the reward over the upcoming 5-minute interval under the given reward structure.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.75, 0.65, 0.8, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

- Zone 2: 25.9°C (very close to setpoint), trending -0.02°C/min → 5-min change ≈ -0.10°C → forecast ≈ 25.8°C (slightly cool but within band).
- Zone 3: 26.4°C (0.4 above setpoint), trending -0.02°C/min → forecast ≈ 26.3°C.
- Zone 4: 26.9°C (0.9 above setpoint, near upper band), trending -0.02°C/min → forecast ≈ 26.8°C (still on warm side but just under 27°C).
All zones are within 25–27°C and already cooling slightly with current actions. We want mild additional cooling for the warmer zones (1 & 4) but avoid overcooling Zone 2.

2) CO2 assessment and trajectory:
- Threshold: target 1000 ppm, violation at 1100 ppm.
Current values and 5-min projections (assuming similar trends):
- Zone 1: 942 ppm, +9.7 ppm/min → +48.5 ppm in 5 min → ≈ 990 ppm, near 1000 but below violation.
- Zone 2: 782 ppm, +7.5 ppm/min → +37.5 → ≈ 820 ppm.
- Zone 3: 844 ppm, +8.4 ppm/min → +42 → ≈ 886 ppm.
- Zone 4: 805 ppm, +7.9 ppm/min → +39.5 → ≈ 845 ppm.
Zone 1 is approaching the 1000 ppm target; others are comfortably below. Outdoor air damper is at minimum (0.05), which limits ventilation; however, increasing OA raises cooling load because outdoor is 32.3°C (much hotter than indoor). CO2 penalties are moderate (weight 0.5) and violation penalty only at 1100 ppm. For a single 5-min step, Zone 1 likely remains below 1000 even if OA stays at minimum, but trend suggests we should start modestly increasing OA now to avoid hitting 1000+ in coming intervals while keeping energy reasonable.

3) Energy / equipment state:
- Outdoor temperature: 32.3°C (well above indoor 26°C) → economizer cooling is not beneficial; OA mostly for CO2 control.
- Previous actions:
  - Zone dampers: [0.75, 0.65, 0.8, 0.9]
  - OA damper: 0.05 (minimum)
  - Coil valve: 0.6
  - Fan speed: 0.7
These are moderate-to-high airflow to Zone 4 (0.9) and fairly open to Zones 1 & 3. Coil valve at 0.6 is a moderate cooling level. Fan at 0.7 is moderate. Given zones are slightly warm and cooling slowly, we should maintain or very slightly increase central cooling effectiveness for warmer zones without a big fan power increase, because power_weight=0.2 suggests energy has a noticeable penalty.

4) Tradeoff reasoning:
- Comfort: Keep all zones in band, nudge 1, 3, 4 a bit cooler, keep 2 close to center but not much cooler.
- CO2: Zone 1 is the only concern; a small OA increase should help slow the rise, without a big energy hit.
- Power: Avoid large jumps in fan speed or coil valve that significantly raise power.

Given 5-minute horizon and relatively slow dynamics indicated by temp and CO2 trends:
- Coil valve: Slightly increase from 0.6 to 0.65 to gently increase cooling capacity so warmer zones cool a bit more but avoid overshoot.
- Fan speed: Keep at 0.7 to avoid increasing fan power; existing airflow is already providing slight cooling trends.
- OA damper: Raise modestly from 0.05 to 0.10 (still low but provides roughly double minimum OA) to improve CO2 without a large sensible load increase. Outdoor is hot, so we stay far below max (0.6).
- Zone dampers: Rebalance to favor warmer, high CO2 zone(s) and slightly reduce flow to the coolest zone:
  - Zone 1 (26.6°C, 942 ppm): Keep relatively high; slightly increase from 0.75 to 0.8 for more cooling and fresh air.
  - Zone 2 (25.9°C, coolest, 782 ppm): Slightly decrease from 0.65 to 0.6 to prevent overcooling and reduce unnecessary flow/energy.
  - Zone 3 (26.4°C, 844 ppm): Slightly reduce or maintain to balance; it's only mildly warm and CO2 is ok. Keep at 0.8 → 0.78 (minor trim) to shift a bit of capacity to Zone 1 & 4 while not destabilizing.
  - Zone 4 (26.9°C, warmest, 805 ppm): Keep high to cool it more; maintain 0.9 or nudge to 0.92. Given energy tradeoff and already high damper, a small increase to 0.92 is reasonable.
All values remain within their bounds.

5) Final actions (clipped to bounds):
- zone_dampers: [0.8, 0.6, 0.78, 0.92] (all within [0.05, 1.0])
- oa_damper: 0.10 (within [0.05, 0.6])
- coil_valve: 0.65 (within [0.06, 1.0])
- fan_speed: 0.7 (within [0.45, 1.4])
This should keep all zones in the comfort band, slow or slightly reverse the warming in Zones 1, 3, and 4, modestly improve CO2 (especially in Zone 1) and avoid large increases in power consumption.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.6, 0.78, 0.92], ""oa_damper"": 0.1, ""coil_valve"": 0.65, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- Current zone temps:
  - Z1: 26.6°C (slightly warm, trending down -0.02°C/min → about -0.1°C over 5 min → projected ≈ 26.5°C)
  - Z2: 25.8°C (slightly cool relative to setpoint but in band, projected ≈ 25.75°C)
  - Z3: 26.3°C (slightly warm, projected ≈ 26.2°C)
  - Z4: 26.8°C (warmest, projected ≈ 26.7°C)
All zones are within comfort band and trending slightly cooler already.

- CO2:
  - Z1: 980 ppm, rising 7.4 ppm/min → +37 ppm in 5 min → ≈ 1017 ppm (above 1000 target but below 1100 violation).
  - Z2: 814 ppm → ≈ 846 ppm
  - Z3: 881 ppm → ≈ 917 ppm
  - Z4: 838 ppm → ≈ 871 ppm
Only Z1 is close to the 1000 ppm target; projected slight exceedance but still under violation threshold.

- Outdoor: 32.2°C (much hotter than indoors), trending slightly cooler but still hot. Increasing OA damper significantly would raise load.

- Previous action:
  - Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.6, 0.78, 0.92]
  - OA damper: 0.10
  - Coil valve: 0.65
  - Fan speed: 0.70
Comfort already acceptable, temperatures trending gently down, so there is room to reduce energy while keeping within comfort and CO2 constraints.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes
Goals:
- Keep all temps well within 25–27°C and near 26°C.
- Prevent CO2 from rising too much above 1000 ppm, especially in Z1.
- Reduce energy: lower fan speed and coil valve where safe, avoid unnecessary OA when outdoor air is hot.

Key considerations:
- CO2 vs energy: CO2 is penalized with weight 0.5; power with 0.2. However, Z1 projected CO2 ~1017 ppm is just above the 1000 ppm target but far below the 1100 ppm violation threshold (which carries an additional large penalty of 10). Slight CO2 exceedance is likely more acceptable than a large increase in power.
- Because outdoor air is much hotter than zones, increasing OA damper substantially would increase cooling demand. With coil valve already at 0.65, more OA could require more coil and fan power; likely not worth it for a small CO2 overshoot in one zone.
- Cooling: All zones are within band and already cooling slowly. We can modestly reduce cooling capacity and airflow to save energy while staying in band.

3) Zone damper adjustments
- Z4 is warmest (26.8°C → 26.7°C projected). It likely benefits from maintaining relatively high airflow, but we can slightly trim to save fan energy since it remains in band.
- Z1 is also warmish (26.6 → 26.5) and has the highest CO2. Keeping its damper relatively open helps both temperature and CO2 dilution.
- Z3 is only slightly warm; Z2 is slightly cool relative to setpoint.

Proposed qualitative changes:
- Z1: keep high but not maximum; slightly reduce from 0.80 to around 0.78 to save a bit of flow while still prioritizing this zone.
- Z4: reduce a bit more from 0.92 to around 0.88 (still high to manage warmth, but less fan energy).
- Z3: can be trimmed modestly from 0.78 to 0.74.
- Z2: coolest; reduce from 0.60 to about 0.55 to save energy and avoid overcooling.
All remain well within [0.05, 1.0]. These are mild adjustments to avoid abrupt changes.

4) Outdoor air damper
- Currently 0.10 (near minimum 0.05). Outdoor is 32.2°C, much hotter than indoor; more OA raises cooling load.
- Z1 CO2 will cross 1000 ppm but stay far below 1100 ppm; slight exceedance is likely cheaper than extra cooling energy.
- Keeping OA at 0.10 balances minimum ventilation and energy.
So: keep OA damper at 0.10.

5) Coil valve (cooling)
- Currently 0.65. All zones are within band and trending down slowly, so the coil can be decreased slightly to cut chiller/pump power and reduce risk of overcooling later.
- Too large a reduction might slow or reverse cooling, raising temps above ~27°C over a longer horizon, but over 5 minutes, a modest reduction is safe.
- Reduce from 0.65 to about 0.60. This should still provide significant cooling given outdoor 32.2°C and current fan speed, but with reduced energy.

6) Fan speed
- Currently 0.70, bounds [0.45, 1.4]. Fan contributes directly to power and interacts with zone dampers and OA for cooling and CO2.
- Given all temps are in band and trending down, and OA damper is low (minimizing heat gain), we can reduce fan speed slightly to save energy while relying on existing cool air and thermal inertia.
- Z1 CO2 is the main concern; reducing fan speed too much could slow CO2 dilution. However, since OA fraction remains the same and we are only making a small reduction, impact over 5 minutes should be small.
- Reduce from 0.70 to about 0.66. This is a small step to avoid oscillation and preserve comfort/IAQ.

7) Check bounds and consistency
- Zone dampers: [0.78, 0.55, 0.74, 0.88] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.10 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.60 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.66 within [0.45, 1.4].

8) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes
- Temperatures: Slight cooling persists but a bit slower due to reduced coil and fan; all zones should stay close to 26°C and well within 25–27°C.
- CO2: Slightly slower dilution due to lower fan, but OA fraction constant; Z1 may edge a bit over 1000 ppm but should stay far below 1100 ppm, avoiding violation. Other zones remain comfortably under target.
- Energy: Reduced coil valve and fan speed plus slightly lower dampers decrease fan/chiller/pump power, improving reward given comfort is maintained.

This action set balances comfort tracking around 26°C, keeps CO2 near but mostly under target without risk of violation, and reduces energy use compared to previous step.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.78, 0.55, 0.74, 0.88], ""oa_damper"": 0.1, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.66}","{""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current state vs. objectives\n- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.\n- Current zone temps:\n  - Z1: 26.6°C (slightly warm, trending down -0.02°C/min → about -0.1°C over 5 min → projected ≈ 26.5°C)\n  - Z2: 25.8°C (slightly cool relative to setpoint but in band, projected ≈ 25.75°C)\n  - Z3: 26.3°C (slightly warm, projected ≈ 26.2°C)\n  - Z4: 26.8°C (warmest, projected ≈ 26.7°C)\nAll zones are within comfort band and trending slightly cooler already.\n\n- CO2:\n  - Z1: 980 ppm, rising 7.4 ppm/min → +37 ppm in 5 min → ≈ 1017 ppm (above 1000 target but below 1100 violation).\n  - Z2: 814 ppm → ≈ 846 ppm\n  - Z3: 881 ppm → ≈ 917 ppm\n  - Z4: 838 ppm → ≈ 871 ppm\nOnly Z1 is close to the 1000 ppm target; projected slight exceedance but still under violation threshold.\n\n- Outdoor: 32.2°C (much hotter than indoors), trending slightly cooler but still hot.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current conditions:
- All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band and temperatures are slightly decreasing (-0.01°C/min), so thermal comfort is acceptable and trending gently cooler.
  • Zone 1: 26.5°C (0.5 above setpoint), CO2 1018 ppm and rising (≈+37 ppm over next 5 min → ~1055 ppm, above 1000 target but below 1100 violation).
  • Zone 2: 25.8°C, CO2 846 ppm, rising but still comfortably below 1000.
  • Zone 3: 26.3°C, CO2 917 ppm, projected ≈952 ppm.
  • Zone 4: 26.8°C, CO2 870 ppm, projected ≈902 ppm.
- Outdoor: 32.5°C and rising; outdoor air is significantly hotter than indoor, so increasing OA damper too much will raise coil load.
- Previous action: fairly high per-zone dampers (0.55–0.88), moderate OA damper (0.10), moderate coil valve (0.60), moderate fan speed (0.66).

2) Trade-offs vs reward:
- Temperatures are in band and slightly cooling; no need to increase cooling capacity. Slightly reducing cooling (coil and/or fan) will save energy but must not let temps drift above 27°C during the next 5 minutes.
- CO2: main concern is Zone 1 at 1018 ppm and increasing. We should bias more ventilation to Zone 1 and a bit to the other higher-CO2 zones without large increases in central OA fraction or fan speed (to limit power).
- CO2 violation threshold is 1100 ppm; the near-term projection for Zone 1 with unchanged ventilation is ~1055 ppm, still below violation but with a penalty above 1000. Slightly improving ventilation specifically to Zone 1 (and modestly to 3 and 4) helps reduce penalty with limited energy cost.

3) Control strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Zone dampers:
  • Increase Zone 1 damper modestly above 0.78 to give more primary air and OA, improving CO2 dilution; not to max to avoid excessive flow and fan energy. Choose ~0.84.
  • Zone 3 and 4 have elevated but sub-1000 CO2; keep them slightly high but not increased: Zone 3 at 0.74 is fine, Zone 4 at 0.88 is already very open and we can even trim slightly to balance flow while still ensuring good ventilation; set ~0.85.
  • Zone 2 is comfortable and CO2 is low; can reduce its damper a bit to reduce total flow and energy, freeing capacity for Zone 1 without raising fan speed. Reduce from 0.55 to ~0.48 (still above min 0.05).
- OA damper:
  • To control coil load given very hot outside air, avoid big increases in OA fraction. However, we should nudge OA slightly up to help CO2 for all zones, especially Zone 1, while staying near the low end of range.
  • Increase OA damper slightly from 0.10 to 0.12 to modestly improve ventilation with small energy impact.
- Coil valve:
  • Current coil 0.60 with fan 0.66 yields a slight cooling trend. We can shave coil a bit to reduce chiller energy while relying on existing cool air and short 5-min horizon; outdoor is hot, so we should not reduce too aggressively.
  • Reduce coil valve modestly from 0.60 to 0.56; should still maintain temperatures within 25–27°C over next 5 minutes.
- Fan speed:
  • Increasing fan would help CO2 and temperature but costs energy; given comfort is already good, we prefer to keep or slightly reduce fan.
  • Since we slightly raised some dampers (Zone 1) and OA, we keep fan speed at 0.66 to avoid increasing power; a small reduction might reduce ventilation, so hold constant.

4) Bounds check (per provided limits):
- Zone dampers bounds [0.05, 1.0]: proposals 0.84, 0.48, 0.74, 0.85 all within range.
- OA damper bounds [0.05, 0.6]: 0.12 within range.
- Coil valve bounds [0.06, 1.0]: 0.56 within range.
- Fan speed bounds [0.45, 1.4]: 0.66 within range.

5) Expected effect over next 5 min:
- Temperatures: slight further cooling or stabilization near 26°C, all zones remain well within 25–27°C given only small coil reduction and unchanged fan.
- CO2: Zone 1’s higher damper and slightly higher OA fraction should slow or modestly reverse the CO2 rise, reducing penalty and keeping it clearly below 1100 ppm; other zones maintain or slightly improve CO2 with minimal additional energy use.
- Energy: small reduction in coil valve and some reduced flow to Zone 2 help offset any small extra load from the slight OA increase and slightly higher Zone 1 airflow, improving reward balance between comfort/CO2 and power.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.84, 0.48, 0.74, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.12, ""coil_valve"": 0.56, ""fan_speed"": 0.66}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C (band 25–27°C). All zones are currently within band but slightly warm:
  - Zone 1: 26.5°C, drifting down very slowly (-0.01 °C/min).
  - Zone 2: 25.8°C, almost on target, stable.
  - Zone 3: 26.2°C, slightly warm, very slow cooling.
  - Zone 4: 26.7°C, warmest, slow cooling.
- CO2 objective: keep below 1000 ppm and avoid 1100+ ppm.
  - Zone 1: 1049 ppm and rising 6 ppm/min → projected in 5 min ≈ 1079 ppm (still under 1100 but trending toward violation).
  - Zone 2: 875 ppm → projected ≈ 903 ppm.
  - Zone 3: 949 ppm → projected ≈ 981 ppm (close to target but under).
  - Zone 4: 900 ppm → projected ≈ 929 ppm.
- In all zones, CO2 is increasing, indicating occupancy and currently insufficient ventilation to hold levels flat or reduce them.

2) Consider actuator roles and trade-offs:
- Zone dampers (per-zone VAV): more open → more supply air (cooling + dilution of CO2) to that zone, but increases system airflow and fan power.
- OA damper: more outdoor air fraction → better CO2 control (and IAQ), but because outdoor is hot (32.8°C), this increases cooling load and coil valve requirement.
- Coil valve: higher valve → lower supply air temperature (more cooling), more chiller/pump power.
- Fan speed: higher → more airflow → more cooling capacity delivery and more CO2 dilution, but increases fan power.

3) Priorities from current data:
- Biggest immediate risk: CO2 in Zone 1 already above 1000 ppm and rising quickly. Zone 3 is also close to 1000 and rising.
- Thermal comfort is acceptable but trending slightly warm in all but Zone 2. Since outdoor temperature is high and rising, we should avoid backing off cooling too much; a small increase or slight redistribution can pull warmer zones closer to 26°C while we address CO2.
- We want to increase ventilation enough to drive CO2 trends down in high-CO2 zones while constraining energy by:
  - Using targeted per-zone damper adjustments to focus airflow where needed.
  - Moderately increasing OA damper (still near the low side of the allowed range) to improve CO2, but not to the maximum due to hot outdoor air.
  - Making only modest changes to fan speed and coil valve to avoid big power costs.

4) Zone-by-zone reasoning for dampers:
- Previous zone dampers: [Z1=0.84, Z2=0.48, Z3=0.74, Z4=0.85].
- Zone 1: CO2 > 1000, temp 26.5 and only gently cooling. We need more ventilation and moderate extra cooling. Increase damper slightly above 0.84 to get more supply air.
  - New Z1 damper ≈ 0.90.
- Zone 3: CO2 949 rising, temp 26.2 slightly above setpoint. Also needs more vent and modest extra cooling.
  - New Z3 damper ≈ 0.80 (from 0.74).
- Zone 4: warmest at 26.7 but CO2 only 900. Some cooling helpful but CO2 not urgent; we keep it high but avoid further big increases to limit fan power.
  - New Z4 damper ≈ 0.85 → keep as is; its temp is already slowly drifting down and raising it further adds more fan load.
- Zone 2: temp 25.8 (good), CO2 moderate and rising but still under 900. This zone can tolerate slight reduction in airflow to free capacity for zones 1 and 3 and reduce fan energy.
  - New Z2 damper ≈ 0.44 (slight decrease from 0.48).
- All values are within [0.05, 1.0].

5) Outdoor air damper decision:
- Current OA damper: 0.12. CO2 is above target in Zone 1 and approaching in Zone 3, with upward trend in all zones; this indicates that current OA fraction is too low to stabilize CO2.
- Outdoor air is quite hot (32.8°C and increasing), so large OA increases will strongly raise cooling load. However, the CO2 penalty and the risk of crossing 1100+ ppm, especially if occupancy persists, justify a moderate increase.
- Strategy: increase OA damper moderately but stay closer to the lower half of range, balancing IAQ and energy.
  - New OA damper ≈ 0.18 (up from 0.12). This should noticeably improve outside air fraction while not being excessive.

6) Coil valve decision:
- Current coil valve: 0.56. Temperatures: all zones within 25–27°C band, slightly above 26°C target except Zone 2.
- With outdoor at 32.8°C and trends slightly downward but very slow, and with a modest OA increase and slightly more airflow to Zones 1 and 3, cooling demand will rise.
- To prevent temperatures from drifting upward (especially as morning warms further) and to help pull warm zones closer to center comfort temperature without overshoot, a small increase in cooling capacity is appropriate.
- However, large increases would be energy-expensive and could overcool Zone 2. We already slightly reduced Zone 2 airflow to compensate.
  - New coil valve ≈ 0.60 (small increase from 0.56), still mid-range to moderate energy use.

7) Fan speed decision:
- Current fan speed: 0.66. We are increasing OA fraction and some zone dampers (Z1 and Z3) while slightly reducing Z2 and keeping Z4 roughly the same.
- More airflow helps both cooling delivery and CO2 dilution, but fan power grows significantly with speed. We also want to avoid unnecessary over-ventilation beyond what OA damper change already provides.
- The zone damper adjustments already bias more air toward high-need zones. Because OA damper is rising and coil valve is slightly increased, a large fan speed increase is not necessary. But to ensure more effective CO2 dilution in Zones 1 and 3 and to handle added OA, a modest fan increase is reasonable.
  - New fan speed ≈ 0.70 (from 0.66), staying near lower half of allowed [0.45, 1.4] range.

8) Check for constraint satisfaction and risk outlook:
- Zone dampers: [0.90, 0.44, 0.80, 0.85] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.18 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.60 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.70 within [0.45, 1.4].

Expected qualitative effects over next 5 minutes:
- CO2: Additional OA plus increased airflow to Zones 1 and 3 should reduce the rate of increase; depending on occupancy, Zone 1 may plateau near or just above 1050 ppm rather than drifting close to 1100, reducing risk of violation penalty. Zone 3 may stabilize below 1000 or rise more slowly.
- Temperature: Slightly increased coil valve and fan speed plus higher flow to warmer zones will gently nudge temps in Zones 1, 3, and 4 closer to 26°C while keeping Zone 2 near its current ~25.8°C thanks to reduced damper.
- Energy: Changes are incremental rather than large jumps, balancing comfort/IAQ improvements against fan and chiller energy.

This zone can tolerate slight reduction in airflow to free capacity for zones 1 and 3 and reduce fan energy.\n  - New Z2 damper ≈ 0.44 (slight decrease from 0.48).\n- All values are within [0.05, 1.0].\n\n5) Outdoor air damper decision:\n- Current OA damper: 0.12. CO2 is above target in Zone 1 and approaching in Zone 3, with upward trend in all zones; this indicates that current OA fraction is too low to stabilize CO2.\n- Outdoor air is quite hot (32.8°C and increasing), so large OA increases will strongly raise cooling load. However, the CO2 penalty and the risk of crossing 1100+ ppm, especially if occupancy persists, justify a moderate increase.\n- Strategy: increase OA damper moderately but stay closer to the lower half of range, balancing IAQ and energy.\n  - New OA damper ≈ 0.18 (up from 0.12). This should noticeably improve outside air fraction while not being excessive.\n\n6) Coil valve decision:\n- Current coil valve: 0.56. Temperatures: all zones within 25–27°C band, slightly above 26°C target except Zone 2.\n- With outdoor at 32.8°C and trends slightly downward but very slow, and with a modest OA increase and slightly more airflow to Zones 1 and 3, cooling demand will rise.\n- To prevent temperatures from drifting upward (especially as morning warms further) and to help pull warm zones closer to center comfort temperature without overshoot, a small increase in cooling capacity is appropriate.\n- However, large increases would be energy-expensive and could overcool Zone 2. We already slightly reduced Zone 2 airflow to compensate.\n  - New coil valve ≈ 0.60 (small increase from 0.56), still mid-range to moderate energy use.\n\n7) Fan speed decision:\n- Current fan speed: 0.66. We are increasing OA fraction and some zone dampers (Z1 and Z3) while slightly reducing Z2 and keeping Z4 roughly the same.\n- More airflow helps both cooling delivery and CO2 dilution, but fan power grows significantly with speed. We also want to avoid unnecessary over-ventilation beyond what OA damper change already provides.\n- The zone damper adjustments already bias more air toward high-need zones. Because OA damper is rising and coil valve is slightly increased, a large fan speed increase is not necessary. But to ensure more effective CO2 dilution in Zones 1 and 3 and to handle added OA, a modest fan increase is reasonable.\n  - New fan speed ≈ 0.70 (from 0.66), staying near lower half of allowed [0.45, 1.4] range.\n\n8) Check for constraint satisfaction and risk outlook:\n- Zone dampers: [0.90, 0.44, 0.80, 0.85] all within [0.05, 1.0].\n- OA damper: 0.18 within [0.05, 0.6].\n- Coil valve: 0.60 within [0.06, 1.0].\n- Fan speed: 0.70 within [0.45, 1.4].\n\nExpected qualitative effects over next 5 minutes:\n- CO2: Additional OA plus increased airflow to Zones 1 and 3 should reduce the rate of increase; depending on occupancy, Zone 1 may plateau near or just above 1050 ppm rather than drifting close to 1100, reducing risk of violation penalty. Zone 3 may stabilize below 1000 or rise more slowly.\n- Temperature: Slightly increased coil valve and fan speed plus higher flow to warmer zones will gently nudge temps in Zones 1, 3, and 4 closer to 26°C while keeping Zone 2 near its current ~25.8°C thanks to reduced damper.\n- Energy: Changes are incremental rather than large jumps, balancing comfort/IAQ improvements against fan and chiller energy.\n\n9) Final action: use the above tuned setpoints, clipped to bounds."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret objectives and current state:
- Comfort target: 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy while meeting comfort and CO2 constraints.
- Interval: 5 minutes.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 26.4°C (slightly warm but in band), trend ~0°C/min (flat), CO2 = 1083 ppm and rising 6.6 ppm/min → projected in 5 min ≈ 1083 + 6.6*5 = 1116 ppm → will exceed the 1100 ppm violation threshold if we do nothing.
- Zone 2: 25.8°C (good), very slight warming 0.01°C/min, CO2 = 916 ppm trending up 8 ppm/min → ≈ 956 ppm in 5 min, still below 1000 ppm but creeping up.
- Zone 3: 26.2°C (good), slight cooling, CO2 = 983 ppm rising 6.6 ppm/min → ≈ 1016 ppm, above the 1000 target but likely below 1100.
- Zone 4: 26.7°C (near upper band limit), flat temp, CO2 = 926 ppm, rising 5.2 ppm/min → ≈ 952 ppm.

Outdoor: 32.5°C, trending cooler but still much hotter than indoor zones. So more outdoor air increases cooling load; we should only increase OA as needed for CO2 control.

Previous actuators:
- Zone dampers: [0.9, 0.44, 0.8, 0.85]
- OA damper: 0.18 (low-moderate)
- Coil valve: 0.6 (moderate cooling)
- Fan speed: 0.7 (moderate flow)

2) Key constraints and trade-offs:
- CO2 is the most urgent in Zone 1: projected to cross 1100 ppm in 5 minutes → triggers a large discrete penalty. We must avoid this by increasing ventilation.
- Secondary: keep all zones within 25–27°C, with preference around 26°C.
- Energy: fan, coil, and OA fraction all increase energy use; but avoiding CO2 violation is more important than small extra energy.

3) Ventilation / CO2 strategy:
- To reduce / reverse CO2 buildup:
  • Increase outdoor air fraction (OA damper).
  • Increase total airflow (fan speed).
  • Possibly adjust zone dampers to favor high-CO2 zones.

- OA damper: currently 0.18 (quite low). To significantly mitigate CO2, we should raise OA, but keep in mind outdoor is hot so more OA adds load.
  • Zone 1 already high and projected to violate; Zone 3 projected to exceed 1000 ppm as well.
  • Target OA somewhere in the mid-range, enough to prevent the violation but not maxing out.
  • A step up to around 0.3–0.35 is a good compromise: almost doubling OA relative to 0.18 without jumping to the 0.6 max.

- Fan speed: raising fan speed increases total supply airflow; combined with higher OA fraction, this increases absolute outdoor air delivery to zones and helps mix temperatures.
  • Currently 0.7. A moderate increase to ~0.8 will boost ventilation while not being extreme for energy.

4) Cooling / comfort strategy:
- Zone temps vs target 26°C:
  • Z1 26.4°C (slightly high) → mild need for more cooling.
  • Z2 25.8°C (slightly low but close) → essentially fine.
  • Z3 26.2°C (slightly high, trending down already) → fine.
  • Z4 26.7°C (upper edge, flat) → some additional cooling needed.

- Coil valve: at 0.6. We’ll be increasing OA and fan speed, bringing in warmer air; to maintain or slightly increase cooling capacity, we should either maintain or slightly increase coil valve.
  • Slight increase to ~0.65 makes sense: enough extra cooling to offset warmer OA and bring Z1 and Z4 a bit cooler, while still balancing energy use.

5) Zone damper adjustments:
- We can bias airflow toward zones needing more cooling and with higher CO2, without huge changes to avoid oscillations.
- Zone by zone:
  • Zone 1: high temp (26.4°C) and highest CO2 (1083) with violation risk. Increase damper slightly above 0.9 toward upper bound 1.0 to give more cool and fresh air. Set near 0.95.
  • Zone 2: near target temp and moderate CO2, no urgent need for extra air. Could slightly reduce damper from 0.44 to free airflow capacity for other zones, but not too low to avoid stagnation. Maybe ~0.4.
  • Zone 3: temp fine but CO2 near 1000 and rising; give it modestly more air than before. From 0.8 to ~0.85.
  • Zone 4: warmest zone (26.7°C), CO2 modest; extra supply will help cool it. From 0.85 to ~0.9.

- Check bounds for all actions:
  • Zone dampers must be in [0.05, 1.0] → all proposed in range.
  • OA damper in [0.05, 0.6] → choose 0.35; in range.
  • Coil valve in [0.06, 1.0] → 0.65; in range.
  • Fan speed in [0.45, 1.4] → 0.8; in range.

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- CO2: Higher OA (0.35) and fan (0.8), plus slightly larger dampers for Zones 1 and 3, should reduce or at least stabilize CO2 growth, particularly for Zone 1; this should keep peak CO2 below the 1100 ppm violation threshold and reduce penalty relative to the current strong upward trend.
- Temperatures:
  • Added cooling capacity (coil 0.65) and more airflow to Z1 and Z4 should pull them slightly down toward 26°C, still within comfort band.
  • Z2 and Z3 may cool slightly or stay about the same; they are already in-band.
- Energy: Slight increases in fan, OA, and coil do increase power use, but this is justified to avoid the large CO2 violation penalty and maintain comfort.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm.
- Minimize power via lower fan, coil, and damper openings, but not at the expense of comfort/CO2.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.4°C (slightly warm but within band), dT/dt=-0.01°C/min (cooling slowly). CO2=1069 ppm (>1000 target, below 1100 threshold), dCO2/dt=-2.4 ppm/min (trending downward but still high).
- Zone 2: T=25.9°C (nearly ideal), dT/dt=+0.01°C/min (slow warming). CO2=933 ppm (<1000), rising at +3.1 ppm/min.
- Zone 3: T=26.1°C (near ideal), dT/dt=-0.01°C/min (slight cooling). CO2=984 ppm (very close to 1000), flat trend.
- Zone 4: T=26.7°C (warm but in band), dT/dt=-0.01°C/min (slight cooling). CO2=917 ppm, trending down.

Outdoor: 32.3°C, much hotter than indoors, so more outdoor air increases cooling load. Trend is cooling outside but still substantially warmer during this interval. Prior settings: relatively high cooling and ventilation (fan 0.8, coil 0.65, OA 0.35, several zone dampers high).

2) Key trade-offs over next 5 minutes:
- CO2:
  * Z1 at 1069 ppm is above target and fairly close to the 1100 violation threshold, but trending down.
  * Z3 at 984 ppm is right below target, flat trend; could cross 1000 if ventilation or airflow reduce.
  * Z2 at 933 ppm rising; but even +3.1 ppm/min * 5 ≈ +15.5 ppm → ~948 ppm, still below target.
  * Z4 safe and trending down.
  → Need to maintain or slightly improve ventilation to Z1 and Z3 in particular, without letting CO2 climb.

- Temperature:
  * All zones in comfort band; Z1 and Z4 slightly warm but already cooling slowly. Z2 slightly below setpoint but in band and warming slightly; Z3 nearly ideal.
  → We can modestly reduce cooling power (coil and/or fan) without immediate comfort violations, but must avoid causing temperatures to drift above 27°C in Z1/Z4.

- Energy:
  * Fan speed 0.8 is relatively high. Coil valve 0.65 is moderate. OA damper 0.35 is mid-range, but given hot outside air, OA flow is a strong energy and temperature driver.
  → Energy savings most easily from a small reduction in fan and coil, and ideally slightly lower OA fraction while still meeting CO2 risk constraints.

3) Strategy per actuator:
- Zone dampers: Reallocate airflow priority toward zones with high CO2 and/or warmer temps, and slightly reduce for better zones, but avoid drastic changes to prevent instability.
  * Zone 1: High CO2 (1069, decreasing) and slightly warm; keep damper high to maintain ventilation and cooling. Maybe reduce slightly from 0.95 (near max) to 0.9 to trim energy but still prioritize Z1.
  * Zone 2: Near-ideal temperature, CO2 below target but rising. Prior damper 0.4. Keep similar or slightly lower (e.g., 0.35–0.4). To avoid rising CO2 too fast, avoid cutting too much; 0.35 is a small reduction.
  * Zone 3: Near-ideal temp, CO2 984 near target; should keep moderate airflow to prevent CO2 crossing 1000. Prior 0.85 is high; can modestly trim to around 0.75 while relying on still-elevated OA and fan.
  * Zone 4: Warmest temp 26.7 but cooling; CO2 is safe and decreasing. Prior 0.9 is high. To save energy yet preserve cooling, reduce moderately, e.g., to 0.8.

- OA damper:
  * Prior 0.35. Outdoor air is much warmer, so reducing OA reduces cooling load but may increase CO2.
  * Given Z1 already above target and Z3 close, aggressive OA reduction risks CO2 approaching 1100 in Z1 or crossing 1000 in Z3.
  * Z1 CO2 is already falling with OA 0.35; we can try a slight reduction to 0.3 to save some load while expecting CO2 in Z1 to still trend downward, and not harming Z3 too much with only a modest cut.

- Coil valve:
  * With outside at 32.3°C and two zones slightly warm, we should not reduce coil too much. However, temps are already slowly cooling, so a small reduction from 0.65 to ~0.6 seems reasonable to reduce chiller energy while keeping adequate cooling.

- Fan speed:
  * Currently 0.8. Lowering fan reduces power but also reduces both cooling delivery and ventilation to zones, which affects temps and CO2.
  * Because CO2 is the tightest constraint (Z1 & Z3), we should only reduce fan speed slightly. A change from 0.8 to 0.75 yields some energy savings while still maintaining good ventilation.

4) Sanity check on projected short-term effects (qualitative):
- CO2: Slightly lower OA and fan might slow CO2 reduction in Z1 and Z4 and increase CO2 in Z2 and Z3 a bit, but zone dampers for Z1 remain high and Z3 moderate-high. Over 5 minutes, magnitudes of change are small; risk of Z1 exceeding 1100 is low if its current negative trend persists, and Z3 should stay roughly near or slightly above 1000 but still well below violation threshold, balancing penalty vs energy.
- Temperature: Slightly lower coil and slightly lower airflow plus modest damper cuts in Z2/3/4 will slow cooling, but all zones are within the comfort band with small trends. Over 5 minutes, no zone is likely to exceed 27°C, especially with continued albeit slightly reduced cooling.
- Energy: Reductions in fan (0.8→0.75), coil (0.65→0.6), OA (0.35→0.3), and some damper trims should reduce fan and cooling power, boosting reward.

5) Apply bounds and finalize numeric choices:
- Bounds: zone dampers [0.05, 1.0], oa [0.05, 0.6], coil [0.06,1.0], fan [0.45,1.4].
- Proposed within bounds: zone_dampers [0.9, 0.35, 0.75, 0.8], oa_damper 0.3, coil_valve 0.6, fan_speed 0.75.

These settings maintain a strong focus on Z1/Z3 air supply for CO2 and temperature while gently reducing plant energy.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.35, 0.75, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:\n- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.\n- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm.\n- Minimize power via lower fan, coil, and damper openings, but not at the expense of comfort/CO2.\n\nZone conditions:\n- Zone 1: T=26.4°C (slightly warm but within band), dT/dt=-0.01°C/min (cooling slowly). CO2=1069 ppm (>1000 target, below 1100 threshold), dCO2/dt=-2.4 ppm/min (trending downward but still high).\n- Zone 2: T=25.9°C (nearly ideal), dT/dt=+0.01°C/min (slow warming). CO2=933 ppm (<1000), rising at +3.1 ppm/min.\n- Zone 3: T=26.1°C (near ideal), dT/dt=-0.01°C/min (slight cooling). CO2=984 ppm (very close to 1000), flat trend.\n- Zone 4: T=26.7°C (warm but in band), dT/dt=-0.01°C/min (slight cooling). CO2=917 ppm, trending down.\n\nOutdoor: 32.3°C, much hotter than indoors, so more outdoor air increases cooling load. Trend is cooling outside but still substantially warmer during this interval. Prior settings: relatively high cooling and ventilation (fan 0.8, coil 0.65, OA 0.35, several zone dampers high).\n\n2) Key trade-offs over next 5 minutes:\n- CO2:\n  * Z1 at 1069 ppm is above target and fairly close to the 1100 violation threshold, but trending down.\n  * Z3 at 984 ppm is right below target, flat trend; could cross 1000 if ventilation or airflow reduce.\n  * Z2 at 933 ppm rising; but even +3.1 ppm/min * 5 ≈ +15.5 ppm → ~948 ppm, still below target.\n  * Z4 safe and trending down.\n  → Need to maintain or slightly improve ventilation to Z1 and Z3 in particular, without letting CO2 climb.\n\n- Temperature:\n  * All zones in comfort band; Z1 and Z4 slightly warm but already cooling slowly. Z2 slightly below setpoint but in band and warming slightly; Z3 nearly ideal.\n  → We can modestly reduce cooling power (coil and/or fan) without immediate comfort violations, but must avoid causing temperatures to drift above 27°C in Z1/Z4.\n\n- Energy:\n  * Fan speed 0.8 is relatively high. Coil valve 0.65 is moderate. OA damper 0.35 is mid-range, but given hot outside air, OA flow is a strong energy and temperature driver.\n  → Energy savings most easily from a small reduction in fan and coil, and ideally slightly lower OA fraction while still meeting CO2 risk constraints.\n\n3) Strategy per actuator:\n- Zone dampers: Reallocate airflow priority toward zones with high CO2 and/or warmer temps, and slightly reduce for better zones, but avoid drastic changes to prevent instability.\n  * Zone 1: High CO2 (1069, decreasing) and slightly warm; keep damper high to maintain ventilation and cooling.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret key observations:
- Setpoint is 26°C with comfort band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps: Z1 26.3 (slightly above setpoint, cooling slowly), Z2 25.9 (near setpoint, slightly warming), Z3 26.1 (near setpoint, slightly cooling), Z4 26.7 (warmest, essentially flat).
- CO2: Z1 1073 ppm (already above 1000 target and trending up), Z2 956 and rising quickly, Z3 996 and rising, Z4 923 and rising. Risk of crossing 1000 ppm across all zones and hitting 1100 ppm in Z1 within the next intervals if not addressed.
- Outdoor is hot at 32.5°C and rising, so increased outdoor air for CO2 control will increase cooling load.
- Previous actions: fairly high dampers in Z1, Z3, Z4, moderate in Z2; OA damper 0.3; coil valve 0.6; fan 0.75.

2) Priorities from reward:
- Keep temperatures within 25–27°C (all zones currently inside band, but Z4 is closest to upper bound; we need cooling there).
- Keep CO2 below 1000 ppm to avoid continuous penalties, and especially below 1100 ppm to avoid large violation penalty.
- Minimise power (fan, coil/chiller, pumps) but not at the expense of CO2/comfort constraints.

3) CO2 control strategy:
- Z1: 1073 ppm and +0.9 ppm/min → ~+4.5 ppm over 5 minutes to ~1077 ppm. Already above target; we must counter this trend, ideally pulling it back down and away from 1100. Need more outdoor air and strong supply to that zone.
- Z2: 956 ppm, +4.2 ppm/min → +21 ppm → ~977 ppm in 5 minutes, likely over 1000 soon afterward. Needs increased ventilation.
- Z3: 996 ppm, +2.3 ppm/min → ~1007 ppm in 5 minutes, so above target imminently.
- Z4: 923 ppm rising but less critical.
- Therefore: modestly increase OA damper to raise overall ventilation, and avoid reducing fan speed (might even slightly increase to distribute more air). We can also bias zone dampers for zones with highest CO2 (Z1, Z3, Z2) while keeping Z4 adequate.

4) Thermal comfort & cooling:
- Outdoor is much hotter than the zones, so increasing OA raises cooling load. We must keep coil valve strong enough to offset extra heat.
- Z4 is warmest at 26.7°C and flat trend → needs more cooling airflow, not less.
- Z1, Z2, Z3 are near 26°C; some are slightly cooling, one slightly warming. With hot outside air, raising OA without enough coil could cause warming, so coil should be maintained or slightly increased.

5) Power considerations:
- Fan power roughly scales with speed^3, so large increases are costly. A small increment from 0.75 to about 0.8 balances more ventilation vs power/comfort.
- Coil valve at 0.6 may be borderline given 32.5°C OA and increased OA fraction. Slightly raising to ~0.65–0.7 will help maintain comfort while not maxing energy.
- OA damper increase from 0.3 to ~0.4–0.45 will improve CO2 while not fully opening to maximum 0.6 (which would be high load).

6) Zone damper adjustments:
- Bounds: [0.05, 1.0]. We can redistribute zone flows without changing total fan speed dramatically.
- Z1 (26.3°C, 1073 ppm): Needs strong cooling and high ventilation. Keep damper high or slightly increase relative share. From 0.9 → 0.95 (near max but not fully).
- Z3 (26.1°C, 996 ppm): Also needs good ventilation to avoid crossing 1000 and maintain temp. From 0.75 → 0.8.
- Z2 (25.9°C, 956 ppm, warming): Needs more ventilation and some cooling as it’s trending up. From 0.35 → 0.5 (larger relative bump, as it was quite restricted).
- Z4 (26.7°C, 923 ppm): Warmest but CO2 relatively better. It still needs cooling, so we should not cut it; perhaps a slight reduction to free capacity for high-CO2 zones, but not too much. From 0.8 → 0.75 to favor Z1/Z2/Z3 air while still providing strong flow to cool.
- This rebalancing plus a small fan-speed increase should improve both CO2 and thermal comfort.

7) Coil valve and OA damper setting:
- OA damper: from 0.3 → 0.42 (moderate increase) to support CO2 reduction without huge load.
- Coil valve: from 0.6 → 0.68 to ensure the mixed air is cool enough to manage the additional OA and to cool Z4 down a bit while holding others in band.

8) Fan speed:
- From 0.75 → 0.8 for more ventilation and cooling. This is a modest increment to limit power penalty while boosting airflow.

9) Clip to bounds and finalise:
- Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.5, 0.8, 0.75] all within [0.05,1.0].
- OA damper: 0.42 within [0.05,0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.68 within [0.06,1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.8 within [0.45,1.4].

These actions aim to prevent CO2 from drifting further above target (especially Z1 and Z3), keep all zones within the 25–27°C comfort band with extra cooling to Z4, and only modestly increase energy use.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.5, 0.8, 0.75], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 0.68, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Comfort target: 26°C, preferred band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; violation if any zone >1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy via lower coil and fan use, and avoid excessive OA when hot outside.

Zone conditions:
- Z1: 26.3°C (slightly warm but within band), trending down (-0.01 °C/min), CO2 1047 ppm (>1000 target, but trending down -4.6 ppm/min).
- Z2: 25.9°C (near setpoint), stable temp, CO2 953 ppm (slightly above target but improving -0.6 ppm/min).
- Z3: 26.1°C, drifting slightly down, CO2 983 ppm, falling (-2.6 ppm/min).
- Z4: 26.7°C (warmest, still within band), trending up slightly (+0.01 °C/min), CO2 910 ppm and decreasing.

Outdoor: 32.8°C and rising → outdoor air is much hotter than indoor; adding excessive OA will increase cooling load.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.5, 0.8, 0.75]
- OA damper: 0.42
- Coil valve: 0.68
- Fan speed: 0.8

2) CO2 considerations:
- Only Z1 is above 1000 ppm (1047), others near but below/around target.
- All trends are downward; with existing ventilation, CO2 is improving.
- 1100 ppm violation threshold is not yet close (Z1 is 1047 with -4.6 ppm/min ≈ -23 ppm in 5 minutes => ~1024 ppm next step).
- So we do NOT need aggressive increase in ventilation; we can slightly maintain or marginally reduce OA if zone-level flows are allocated well.

3) Temperature and comfort:
- All zones inside 25–27°C band; only Z4 is at 26.7 and trending up.
- Coil valve at 0.68 and fan at 0.8 may be stronger than needed; we want to reduce energy while keeping Z4 from drifting above 27°C and maintain modest cooling for Z1 and Z3.
- Outdoor is hot, so OA should not be too high; mixed air temp should stay as low as possible consistent with CO2 targets.

4) Strategy by actuator:
(a) Zone dampers (relative zone airflow allocation):
- Z1: Slightly warm and CO2 highest. Keep high airflow to promote cooling and dilution. Maintain near 0.95, maybe tiny reduction not to overshoot cooling but CO2 is more pressing; keep 0.95.
- Z2: Very close to setpoint, modest CO2. We can slightly reduce its damper to save energy and redirect relative airflow to more demanding zones. Decrease from 0.5 to about 0.45.
- Z3: Slightly warm, CO2 close to target and decreasing. Keep relatively high but not max: maybe keep same 0.8.
- Z4: Warmest, trending up, CO2 fine. Needs more cooling airflow; increase damper from 0.75 to around 0.85.
- All remain within [0.05, 1.0].

(b) OA damper:
- Currently 0.42 with hot outside air; all CO2 trends are improving and well below violation threshold.
- To reduce cooling energy, we can modestly lower OA while staying adequate for CO2. Given downward CO2 trends, a small reduction is reasonable.
- Adjust OA damper from 0.42 to about 0.38–0.4. To be conservative on IAQ, choose 0.40 (within [0.05, 0.6]).

(c) Coil valve (cooling capacity):
- All zones are within band, and most slightly above 26°C except Z2. Z4 trending upward suggests we shouldn’t cut cooling too aggressively.
- But with fan at 0.8 and relatively high zone dampers, coil at 0.68 may be more than needed.
- Modest reduction will save chiller energy while still cooling. Lower to about 0.62.
- Still in [0.06, 1.0].

(d) Fan speed:
- At 0.8 now. Fan energy is significant and penalized.
- We must keep enough airflow to support CO2 dilution and temperature control, particularly for Z1 and Z4.
- Since all temps/CO2 are acceptable and trending in right direction, we can slightly reduce fan speed, not drastically.
- Reduce to about 0.75, still above minimum 0.45.

5) Check likely short-term outcomes (qualitative):
- Z1: High damper + fan 0.75 with coil 0.62 and slightly less OA should keep temp drifting slowly toward 26°C and continue CO2 decrease; we remain away from 1100 ppm.
- Z2: Slight damper reduction may allow temp to creep slightly toward 26 but stay in band; CO2 should remain below violation threshold.
- Z3: Similar or slightly improved comfort with stable or cooler temp; CO2 continues decreasing.
- Z4: Increased damper compensates for slight reductions in fan and coil, helping arrest upward temp drift and keep below 27°C.

6) Bounds and final values:
- zone_dampers: [0.95, 0.45, 0.8, 0.85] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.40 within [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve: 0.62 within [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4].

These settings balance comfort, CO2, and energy over the next 5 minutes by slightly trimming energy while preserving or improving conditions in the most constrained zones (Z1 CO2, Z4 temperature).","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.45, 0.8, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.62, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C within band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimise energy via fan_speed, coil_valve, and unnecessary damper opening.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.3°C (slightly above setpoint but well within band), dT/dt≈0, CO2=1040 ppm (>1000 target, trending down -1.3 ppm/min). Likely just peaked and is improving.
- Zone 2: T=26.0°C (ideal), CO2=957 ppm (<1000, trending up +0.7 ppm/min).
- Zone 3: T=26.0°C (ideal), CO2=979 ppm (just below target, trending down -0.7 ppm/min).
- Zone 4: T=26.7°C (warm but within 27°C limit), CO2=900 ppm (comfortable and trending down).

Outdoor: 33.3°C and rising quickly (trend +6°C/hr). So outdoor air is much hotter than zones, increasing OA fraction greatly would raise cooling load; we should only increase OA modestly to fix CO2.

Previous actuators:
- Dampers: Z1=0.95 (very open), Z2=0.45, Z3=0.80, Z4=0.85.
- OA damper=0.40 (already moderate-high given 0.05–0.6 bounds).
- Coil valve=0.62 (moderate cooling), Fan speed=0.75.

2) CO2 and ventilation reasoning:
- Z1 is slightly over 1000 ppm but already decreasing; with current ventilation it should fall further over next 5 minutes.
- Z2 is at 957 ppm and slowly rising. If unchanged, in 5 minutes: 957 + 0.7*5 ≈ 990 ppm, still within target. So no aggressive ventilation increase needed.
- Z3 is safely trending down from 979 ppm.
- Z4 is low at 900 ppm and decreasing.
Given these, only a slight preference to keep or modestly enhance ventilation where CO2 is high (Z1 and Z2) while not over-ventilating low-CO2 zones (Z4) to save energy.

3) Thermal reasoning:
- All zones are within comfort band. Z4 at 26.7°C is the warmest and flat; outdoor is very hot, so supply air likely needs to remain cool enough to avoid Z4 drifting above 27°C.
- Current coil_valve=0.62 and fan=0.75 are providing sufficient cooling. We can consider a slight reduction to save energy, but must be cautious due to hot outdoor air and Z4 already warm.

4) Strategy for next 5 minutes (high-level):
- Keep overall ventilation similar; maybe small OA tweak but avoid big increases because of 33°C outdoor.
- Slightly rebalance zone dampers to:
  * Maintain strong flow to Z1 (to keep CO2 dropping) and to Z4 (to control temperature).
  * Trim Z3 and especially Z2 a bit if possible without risking CO2 rise above 1000 in Z2.
- Slightly reduce coil_valve to shave chiller energy while monitoring warmest zone (Z4).
- Slightly reduce fan_speed to cut fan power without majorly impacting comfort/CO2.

5) Determine specific adjustments:
Zone dampers (0.05–1.0):
- Z1: CO2 is highest and only slightly above target but falling. Maintain high damper but can reduce a little from 0.95 to 0.90 to save some air while still prioritising it.
- Z2: Good temp, CO2 modestly below target but rising. To avoid crossing 1000 ppm, we should not reduce much. Keep near 0.45; maybe a small bump to 0.50 can help CO2 robustness while changing others.
- Z3: Good temp, CO2 slightly below target and decreasing. We can trim damper a bit to save flow. From 0.80 to 0.70.
- Z4: Warmest zone, CO2 low. We want strong cooling air to prevent surpassing 27°C. Keep damper high but maybe a slight reduction to reduce excessive flow since CO2 is low; but cooling need is more critical. Keep similar or just slightly reduce to 0.80 from 0.85.
This yields: [0.90, 0.50, 0.70, 0.80]. All within [0.05, 1.0].

OA damper (0.05–0.6):
- Current 0.40. CO2 trends overall are acceptable; only Z1 slightly above target but dropping. Increasing OA raises coil load because OA is 33.3°C. We can maintain or even reduce slightly to save energy while relying on relatively high zone dampers to high-CO2 zones.
- However, reducing OA too much could slow CO2 reduction in Z1 and risk Z2 creeping up over time. Given penalty structure, CO2 penalties and violations can be significant.
- Balance: Keep OA at 0.40 to hold current downward trend in most zones and not risk CO2 > 1000 or near 1100, avoiding extra penalty. So set oa_damper=0.40.

Coil valve (0.06–1.0):
- Current 0.62. Outdoor very hot; Z4 is already 26.7°C with 0.62 cooling. Reducing too much could push Z4 above 27°C in next interval, causing comfort band penalty.
- A small reduction should be safe because Z1 is slightly coolish (26.3) and Z2/Z3 are right at 26; still, Z4 is near upper limit.
- To be conservative, only a small reduction, say to 0.58. This should modestly decrease energy while likely keeping Z4 below or around 27°C given only 5 minutes.

Fan speed (0.45–1.4):
- Current 0.75. All zones are stable or slowly drifting; we can reduce air volume slightly while relying on high dampers to key zones.
- Reducing fan speed too much may slow CO2 dilution and cooling, especially for Z4 and Z1.
- Modest reduction to 0.70 should give energy savings with limited impact on zone conditions for a single 5-minute interval.

6) Sanity check vs reward components:
- Comfort: Zones remain in 25–27°C, with emphasis on maintaining or improving Z4 via high damper and only slightly reduced coil and fan.
- CO2: Maintain OA at 0.40 and keep Z1 damper high; Z1’s CO2 is already decreasing, Z2’s damper slightly increased to avoid hitting 1000, Z3 and Z4 trimmed due to good CO2.
- Power: Slight reductions in coil_valve and fan_speed plus trimmed dampers in zones with less need should reduce power_kw without greatly affecting comfort or CO2. This aligns with reward design.

All zones are stable or slowly drifting; we can reduce air volume slightly while relying on high dampers to key zones.\n- Reducing fan speed too much may slow CO2 dilution and cooling, especially for Z4 and Z1.\n- Modest reduction to 0.70 should give energy savings with limited impact on zone conditions for a single 5-minute interval.\n\n6) Sanity check vs reward components:\n- Comfort: Zones remain in 25–27°C, with emphasis on maintaining or improving Z4 via high damper and only slightly reduced coil and fan.\n- CO2: Maintain OA at 0.40 and keep Z1 damper high; Z1’s CO2 is already decreasing, Z2’s damper slightly increased to avoid hitting 1000, Z3 and Z4 trimmed due to good CO2.\n- Power: Slight reductions in coil_valve and fan_speed plus trimmed dampers in zones with less need should reduce power_kw without greatly affecting comfort or CO2. This aligns with reward design.\n\nAll values are within provided actuator bounds and chosen to balance comfort, air quality, and energy for the next 5-minute interval."", ""action"": {""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.58, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}}",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, strong penalty and violation penalty above 1100 ppm.
- Energy: minimise fan and coil use while meeting comfort/CO2.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.3°C (slightly above setpoint but well within band), dT/dt=0.0 → stable. CO2=1040 ppm (>1000 target, flat trend). Needs more ventilation.
- Zone 2: T=26.0°C (on target), slight warming trend. CO2=960 ppm (<1000) but rising at +0.5 ppm/min → ~+2.5 ppm over next 5 min, still <1000 but approaching.
- Zone 3: T=26.1°C (near target), slight warming. CO2=984 ppm (<1000) rising faster, +0.9 ppm/min → ~+4.5 ppm in 5 min, likely to cross 1000 if nothing changes.
- Zone 4: T=26.7°C (toward warm side but within band), slight warming. CO2=895 ppm and decreasing, so ventilation can be slightly relaxed.

Outdoor air: 33.8°C and rising quickly (+6°C/h) → outdoor air is much hotter than indoors, so extra OA significantly increases cooling load. However, CO2 is near/over target in several zones, so we must raise OA enough to avoid CO2 penalties while keeping coil and fan reasonable.

Previous actuators:
- Zone dampers: [0.9, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8]
- OA damper: 0.4 (mid-high, considering hot outdoor air)
- Coil valve: 0.58 (moderate cooling)
- Fan speed: 0.7 (moderate flow)

2) CO2 control strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Zone 1 at 1040 ppm already above target; with current OA and zone damper 0.9, CO2 is flat. To bring CO2 down, slightly increase its share of supply air and overall OA fraction.
- Zones 2 & 3 are just below target and trending up. Without action, Zone 3 likely exceeds 1000 ppm. Increase their ventilation moderately.
- Zone 4 CO2 is low and falling; we can slightly reduce its damper to free up airflow/pressure for other zones and reduce over-ventilation.

Given hot outdoor air, we should not push OA to the max. Modest OA increase plus targeted zone damper adjustments should be enough to keep CO2 near or below 1000 ppm over this 5-min horizon.

3) Temperature/comfort and cooling strategy:
- All zones are within 25–27°C band and close to 26°C. Slight warming trend (~0.01°C/min ≈ 0.05°C over 5 min) plus possible extra heat from higher OA temperature.
- Increasing ventilation (fan and OA damper) will raise internal loads from hot outdoor air, so we likely need a slight increase in cooling (coil) to prevent drift above 27°C, especially for Zone 4 already at 26.7°C.
- Fan speed currently 0.7 is above minimum (0.45). For CO2 reduction, we should maintain or slightly increase fan to improve mixing and ventilation effectiveness, but not too high to avoid energy penalties.

4) Actuator decisions:

Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):
- Goal: increase ventilation to high-CO2 zones, reduce slightly where CO2 is low, without causing large swings.
- Zone 1 (CO2=1040, high, flat): increase zone damper from 0.9 to 0.95 to give it a bit more supply/ventilation.
- Zone 2 (CO2 rising, near target): modest increase from 0.5 to 0.6.
- Zone 3 (CO2 close to target and rising faster): slightly stronger increase from 0.7 to 0.8.
- Zone 4 (CO2 low and decreasing, temp on warm side): reduce damper slightly from 0.8 to 0.7 to trim ventilation/flow and allocate more to others; this also slightly moderates cooling to this warmer zone, but coil and fan increases will offset.

OA damper (bounds 0.05–0.6):
- Trade-off: more OA lowers CO2 but increases cooling load due to 33.8°C outdoor air.
- With several zones at or above 1000 ppm, some OA increase is justified.
- Raise OA damper moderately from 0.4 to 0.45: enough to strengthen CO2 control without large extra chiller load.

Coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0):
- More OA and slightly higher fan will increase sensible and latent cooling load.
- Zone 4 is at 26.7°C and slightly warming; we should avoid it drifting above 27°C.
- Slight increase from 0.58 to 0.62 to counter added heat, keeping all zones in band and near 26°C.

Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4):
- Needed for CO2 dilution and distribution; but high fan speeds are energy-intensive.
- Maintain moderate but slightly higher ventilation by increasing from 0.7 to 0.75, providing more airflow for CO2 control while keeping fan energy reasonable.

5) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.45 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.62 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4].

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- CO2: Increased OA, fan, and high-CO2 zone dampers should stop increases in Zones 2 & 3 and begin reducing Zone 1, keeping all zones around or below 1000 ppm and well below 1100 ppm (avoiding violation penalty).
- Temperature: Slight coil boost should offset extra OA heat, keeping all zones within 25–27°C and clustered near 26°C.
- Energy: Adjustments are incremental, not extreme, so energy penalty should be moderate while satisfying strong comfort/CO2 components.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.62, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy (fan/chiller/pump).

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.3°C (slightly above center but in band), dT/dt≈0, CO2=1024 ppm (above 1000, trending down −3 ppm/min → about −15 ppm over next 5 min → ~1009 ppm, still slightly above target but safely below violation).
- Zone 2: T=26.1°C, stable, CO2=949 ppm, trending down.
- Zone 3: T=26.1°C, stable, CO2=971 ppm, trending down.
- Zone 4: T=26.8°C (near upper band), slightly warming (+0.02°C/min → +0.1°C in 5 min → ~26.9°C which is still <27 but close to upper limit). CO2=890 ppm, falling.

Outdoor:
- Very hot: 33.5°C, decreasing but still far above indoor. So more OA increases sensible load and chiller energy.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7]
- OA damper: 0.45
- Coil valve: 0.62
- Fan speed: 0.75

Bounds:
- Zone dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
- OA damper: [0.05, 0.6]
- Coil valve: [0.06, 1.0]
- Fan speed: [0.45, 1.4]

2) Trade-off analysis:
- Temperatures are inside comfort band; only Zone 4 is drifting up toward the upper limit. We should give Zone 4 a bit more cool air and/or slightly more system cooling.
- CO2: only Zone 1 is above 1000 ppm but already trending down and projected near 1000 in 5 min. Zones 2–4 are comfortably below 1000 and decreasing. This suggests we do NOT need to aggressively increase OA; outdoor air is very hot, so higher OA significantly increases cooling energy.
- Energy: we can consider modest reductions in OA and possibly in fan speed, but must ensure Zone 4 doesn’t overshoot 27°C and CO2 doesn’t rise.

3) Strategy by actuator:

a) Outdoor air damper:
- Current OA=0.45 (quite high given hot outdoor air).
- Since all zones’ CO2 are trending downward and there’s no violation risk, we can reduce OA slightly to cut chiller load, while remaining above minimum (0.05).
- A large drop might slow CO2 decay in Zone 1, keeping it further above 1000 ppm; the CO2 penalty still matters. So make a moderate decrease rather than an aggressive one.
- Choose OA=0.35: reduces heat gain but should still sustain or slowly reduce CO2 given existing downward trends.

b) Coil valve (cooling capacity):
- Zone temps are near setpoint; Zone 4 is warming slightly. Reducing cooling now may let Zone 4 approach or exceed 27°C in the next interval.
- We don’t see a cooling overshoot risk; thus a small increase in cooling can prevent Zone 4 from drifting up, while fan energy is kept moderate.
- Increase slightly from 0.62 to 0.66 for a bit more cooling capacity.

c) Fan speed:
- Current 0.75, bounds [0.45, 1.4]. Fan energy cost is significant; we’d like to avoid increasing speed unless needed.
- With coil valve slightly up, we can keep or slightly reduce fan speed. But because Zone 4 is warmest and slightly rising, a reduction in fan could reduce air delivery and hurt comfort.
- CO2 is already trending downward at current fan/OA; a fan reduction might slow that.
- Best balance: hold fan speed at 0.75 (no increase to avoid extra energy, no decrease to avoid CO2/comfort issues).

d) Zone dampers (VAVs) distribution:
- We should bias more cold air toward hotter / higher CO2 zones (Zone 4 and Zone 1) and reduce flow to cooler / less critical zones (Zone 2 and 3). However, Zone 1 is slightly too warm (26.3) and has highest CO2; Zone 4 is warmest and warming, but its CO2 is low.
- Zone 1: CO2>1000 and slightly warm; keep damper high to ventilate and cool. Already at 0.95 close to max; small change: set to 1.0 to slightly favor Q to Zone 1.
- Zone 4: warmest and rising; increase from 0.7 to 0.8 to curb temperature rise.
- Zone 2: near 26.1°C and low-ish CO2. We can slightly decrease from 0.6 to 0.55 to spare flow for Zones 1 and 4.
- Zone 3: similar to Zone 2; reduce slightly from 0.8 to 0.75.
- These are mild adjustments to avoid instability and keep within bounds.

4) Check against bounds and objectives:
- Zone dampers: [1.0, 0.55, 0.75, 0.8] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.35 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.66 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4].

Expected results next 5 minutes:
- Comfort: Slightly more cooling and redistributed air should hold all zones near 26°C, preventing Zone 4 from reaching 27°C.
- CO2: With OA at 0.35 and similar fan speed, CO2 should continue decreasing or stay near current levels; Zone 1 near 1000 ppm but below violation and likely drifting downward.
- Energy: Reduced OA fraction meaningfully lowers sensible load, and we avoided raising fan speed, so energy is reasonably minimized while preserving comfort and air quality.

Thus this action set should increase the RL reward relative to maintaining previous settings, by slightly improving comfort risk in Zone 4 and reducing OA-related cooling energy, while keeping CO2 under control.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.55, 0.75, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.66, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1) Objectives and current state:\n- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.\n- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.\n- Minimize energy (fan/chiller/pump).\n\nZone conditions:\n- Zone 1: T=26.3°C (slightly above center but in band), dT/dt≈0, CO2=1024 ppm (above 1000, trending down −3 ppm/min → about −15 ppm over next 5 min → ~1009 ppm, still slightly above target but safely below violation).\n- Zone 2: T=26.1°C, stable, CO2=949 ppm, trending down.\n- Zone 3: T=26.1°C, stable, CO2=971 ppm, trending down.\n- Zone 4: T=26.8°C (near upper band), slightly warming (+0.02°C/min → +0.1°C in 5 min → ~26.9°C which is still <27 but close to upper limit). CO2=890 ppm, falling.\n\nOutdoor:\n- Very hot: 33.5°C, decreasing but still far above indoor. So more OA increases sensible load and chiller energy.\n\nPrevious actions:\n- Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.6, 0.8, 0.7]\n- OA damper: 0.45\n- Coil valve: 0.62\n- Fan speed: 0.75\n\nBounds:\n- Zone dampers: [0.05, 1.0]\n- OA damper: [0.05, 0.6]\n- Coil valve: [0.06, 1.0]\n- Fan speed: [0.45, 1.4]\n\n2) Trade-off analysis:\n- Temperatures are inside comfort band; only Zone 4 is drifting up toward the upper limit. We should give Zone 4 a bit more cool air and/or slightly more system cooling.\n- CO2: only Zone 1 is above 1000 ppm but already trending down and projected near 1000 in 5 min. Zones 2–4 are comfortably below 1000 and decreasing. This suggests we do NOT need to aggressively increase OA; outdoor air is very hot, so higher OA significantly increases cooling energy.\n- Energy: we can consider modest reductions in OA and possibly in fan speed, but must ensure Zone 4 doesn’t overshoot 27°C and CO2 doesn’t rise.\n\n3) Strategy by actuator:\n\na) Outdoor air damper:\n- Current OA=0.45 (quite high given hot outdoor air).\n- Since all zones’ CO2 are trending downward and there’s no violation risk, we can reduce OA slightly to cut chiller load, while remaining above minimum (0.05).\n- A large drop might slow CO2 decay in Zone 1, keeping it further above 1000 ppm; the CO2 penalty still matters. So make a moderate decrease rather than an aggressive one.\n- Choose OA=0.35: reduces heat gain but should still sustain or slowly reduce CO2 given existing downward trends.\n\nb) Coil valve (cooling capacity):\n- Zone temps are near setpoint; Zone 4 is warming slightly. Reducing cooling now may let Zone 4 approach or exceed 27°C in the next interval.\n- We don’t see a cooling overshoot risk; thus a small increase in cooling can prevent Zone 4 from drifting up, while fan energy is kept moderate.\n- Increase slightly from 0.62 to 0.66 for a bit more cooling capacity.\n\nc) Fan speed:\n- Current 0.75, bounds [0.45, 1.4]. Fan energy cost is significant; we’d like to avoid increasing speed unless needed.\n- With coil valve slightly up, we can keep or slightly reduce fan speed. But because Zone 4 is warmest and slightly rising, a reduction in fan could reduce air delivery and hurt comfort.\n- CO2 is already trending downward at current fan/OA; a fan reduction might slow that.\n- Best balance: hold fan speed at 0.75 (no increase to avoid extra energy, no decrease to avoid CO2/comfort issues).\n\nd) Zone dampers (VAVs) distribution:\n- We should bias more cold air toward hotter / higher CO2 zones (Zone 4 and Zone 1) and reduce flow to cooler / less critical zones (Zone 2 and 3). However, Zone 1 is slightly too warm (26.3) and has highest CO2; Zone 4 is warmest and warming, but its CO2 is low.\n- Zone 1: CO2>1000 and slightly warm; keep damper high to ventilate and cool. Already at 0.95 close to max; small change: set to 1.0 to slightly favor Q to Zone 1.\n- Zone 4: warmest and rising; increase from 0.7 to 0.8 to curb temperature rise.\n- Zone 2: near 26.1°C and low-ish CO2. We can slightly decrease from 0.6 to 0.55 to spare flow for Zones 1 and 4.\n- Zone 3: similar to Zone 2; reduce slightly from 0.8 to 0.75.\n- These are mild adjustments to avoid instability and keep within bounds.\n\n4) Check against bounds and objectives:\n- Zone dampers: [1.0, 0.55, 0.75, 0.8] all within [0.05, 1.0].\n- OA damper: 0.35 within [0.05, 0.6].\n- Coil valve: 0.66 within [0.06, 1.0].\n- Fan speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4].\n\nExpected results next 5 minutes:\n- Comfort: Slightly more cooling and redistributed air should hold all zones near 26°C, preventing Zone 4 from reaching 27°C.\n- CO2: With OA at 0.35 and similar fan speed, CO2 should continue decreasing or stay near current levels; Zone 1 near 1000 ppm but below violation and likely drifting downward.\n- Energy: Reduced OA fraction meaningfully lowers sensible load, and we avoided raising fan speed, so energy is reasonably minimized while preserving comfort and air quality.\n\nThus this action set should increase the RL reward relative to maintaining previous settings, by slightly improving comfort risk in Zone 4 and reducing OA-related cooling energy, while keeping CO2 under control."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C with comfort band 25–27°C.
- Current temps: Z1=26.3, Z2=26.1, Z3=26.1, Z4=26.9°C, all within comfort band; Z4 is close to upper band and slightly warm relative to 26°C center.
- Temperature trends are ~0°C/min (essentially flat), so current settings are roughly maintaining temps.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; violation threshold: 1100 ppm.
- Current CO2: Z1=1030 (already above 1000 and rising), Z2=954 (rising), Z3=978 (rising), Z4=892 (rising). Z1 is worst and moving further away; Z2+Z3 are just below target and drifting up; Z4 still comfortable but trending up.
- Outdoor air: 33.2°C and trending down but still much hotter than indoor ~26°C, so more OA increases cooling load. However, CO2 penalties and violation penalty are significant, so we must accept some extra energy to avoid high CO2.

2) Consider reward trade-offs:
Reward = comfort_reward - comfort_penalty*band_penalty - power_weight*power_kw - co2_penalty_weight*co2_penalty - co2_violation_penalty.
- Comfort is acceptable now; small reductions in coil or fan to save energy must not cause temp to drift above 27°C, especially Z4 which is 26.9°C.
- CO2_penalty is already non-zero in Z1; we should be proactive to prevent CO2 climbing more and to bring it back under 1000 ppm.
- There is a large discrete penalty if any zone CO2 exceeds 1100 ppm; Z1 at 1030 ppm with a positive slope could reach that in future intervals if not corrected.
- Therefore, priority: boost ventilation a bit and preserve enough cooling to offset extra OA load, while trying not to overshoot energy usage.

3) Analyze current actuators:
Previous action:
- Zone dampers: [1.0, 0.55, 0.75, 0.8]
  * Z1 fully open → max flow, both cooling and ventilation, but still CO2>1000, so OA fraction and/or fan flow may be limiting.
  * Z2 moderately open (0.55), Z3 higher (0.75), Z4 high (0.8). Temps are stable, so these flows are adequate thermally.
- OA damper: 0.35 (on scale 0.05–0.6). This is moderate; with high indoor CO2 trends, increasing OA is the main lever to reduce CO2 across all zones.
- Coil valve: 0.66 (range 0.06–1.0). Medium-high cooling; but outdoor is much hotter, and OA increase will increase load; reducing coil now is risky, especially because Z4 is at 26.9°C and not cooling down.
- Fan speed: 0.75 (range 0.45–1.4). Moderate airflow; raising it helps CO2 dilution and cooling distribution but increases power.

4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- CO2 control:
  * Z1 is above target and rising; we must avoid crossing 1100 ppm. Main effective actions: raise OA fraction and, to a lesser extent, raise fan speed.
  * Zone dampers can’t help Z1 (already at max = 1.0), but we can sustain or slightly adjust others based on temperature needs.
  * Outdoor is hot, so we should increase OA only moderately, not to max, to balance CO2 and energy.
- Temperature control:
  * All temps are in band; Z4 is close to 27°C and flat, meaning cooling is just barely enough. Increasing OA without more coil could push it above 27°C.
  * So we should slightly increase coil valve to maintain or slightly reduce temps when OA is increased.
  * Fan speed should not be reduced; a small increase can help distribute cooling and dilute CO2.
- Energy minimisation:
  * Because CO2 is approaching violation and temps are near the upper side, this is not the best moment to reduce energy. The penalty structure suggests that avoiding CO2 violation and staying within comfort is more important than small short-term power savings.
  * Therefore, accept a modest increase in energy via OA and perhaps fan, with a small coil increment.

5) Concrete actuator decisions and rationale:
A) OA damper:
- Currently 0.35. Increase to improve CO2 while not going to max (0.6) due to 33°C OA.
- A reasonable step: about +0.1 → 0.45. This meaningfully raises OA flow but still leaves margin if CO2 continues to worsen.
- Set: oa_damper = 0.45 (within [0.05, 0.6]).

B) Fan speed:
- Currently 0.75. Higher fan increases mixing, zone airflow, and outdoor air delivery, helping CO2 and cooling.
- However, fan power roughly scales nonlinearly with speed, so big jumps are costly.
- A modest increase: +0.05 → 0.80. This supports CO2 and cooling without a huge energy jump.
- Set: fan_speed = 0.80 (within [0.45, 1.4]).

C) Coil valve:
- Currently 0.66. With more hot OA and slightly higher fan flow, supply air will warm unless we raise coil.
- Z4 is at 26.9°C; to prevent drifting above 27°C, nudge coil up slightly.
- A small increase: +0.04 → 0.70. This should offset extra OA load without overshooting cooling.
- Set: coil_valve = 0.70 (within [0.06, 1.0]).

D) Zone dampers:
- Zone 1: at 1.0, CO2 worst; keep at max to maximise local ventilation and cooling. No change.
- Zone 2 (0.55, 26.1°C, 954 ppm): Slightly under target CO2 but rising; temp comfortably near 26°C. With OA and fan increases, we don’t need a big change. To improve CO2 a bit, we can slightly open damper. Increase to 0.60.
- Zone 3 (0.75, 26.1°C, 978 ppm): Close to 1000 ppm, temp fine. Maintain or very slightly open. Since it’s already relatively high, leave at 0.75 to avoid unnecessary flow/energy.
- Zone 4 (0.8, 26.9°C, 892 ppm): Warmest zone and still under CO2 target. Reducing damper to save energy could raise temp further; we want more cooling here rather than less. With increased fan and coil, we can keep or slightly open the damper. To avoid overcooling risk and keep energy reasonable, keep at 0.80 (not higher), letting the central actions do most of the work.
- Final dampers: [1.0, 0.6, 0.75, 0.8]. All within [0.05, 1.0].

6) Sanity check vs objectives:
- Comfort: Slightly stronger cooling (coil 0.70, same/high dampers, slightly higher fan) should keep all zones within 25–27°C and likely nudge them a bit closer to 26°C, especially Z4.
- CO2: Increased OA (0.45) and fan (0.80) with sustained Z1 damper at 1.0 should slow or reverse CO2 rise, particularly in Z1, and help Z2–Z3 stay under 1000 ppm.
- Energy: Energy use will rise modestly this step, but given the CO2 violation risk and warm Z4, this is a justified trade-off for reward maximization.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current conditions vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, violation at > 1100 ppm.
- Minimize fan/chiller/pump power.

Zone states:
- Zone 1: T=26.2°C (well within band, slightly above setpoint), dT/dt≈0, CO2=1009 ppm (>1000, slightly high), CO2 trend=-3.7 ppm/min (decreasing).
- Zone 2: T=26.1°C, stable, CO2=942 ppm (<1000), decreasing.
- Zone 3: T=26.1°C, stable, CO2=967 ppm (<1000), decreasing.
- Zone 4: T=26.9°C (near upper band limit but still within), stable, CO2=876 ppm, decreasing.

Outdoor air: 33.9°C and rising quickly. So outdoor air is much hotter than indoors; more OA hurts cooling energy and may warm zones.

2) Assess current actuation:
Previous action:
- Zone dampers: [1.0, 0.6, 0.75, 0.8]
- OA damper: 0.45 (quite high given hot outside air)
- Coil valve: 0.7 (strong cooling)
- Fan speed: 0.8 (above minimum 0.45)

Zones are all inside the 25–27°C band and roughly stable; Zone 4 is a bit warm. CO2 in Zone 1 is just over 1000 but trending down even with these settings.

Given CO2 trends are negative everywhere, we might be able to slightly reduce airflow/ventilation to save energy while keeping CO2 < 1000 and far from 1100.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes (planning ahead):
- Cooling: Outdoor is much hotter than indoors; we need to maintain enough cooling capacity but can gently trim if temps are stable.
- CO2: Only Zone 1 is just above 1000 but already decreasing at -3.7 ppm/min. Over 5 minutes, this alone gives ~ -18.5 ppm, bringing Zone 1 to ~990 ppm if conditions persist. So no need to increase OA; we can even slightly reduce OA to cut thermal load and energy while staying safe.
- Energy: Reduce fan speed modestly, keep coil in a moderate-to-high range to prevent Zone 4 from overheating, and avoid oversupplying cool air to zones that are already comfortable.

4) Zone-damper adjustments:
- Zone 1: Needs some ventilation for CO2, but CO2 is already improving. Temperature is fine. Keep damper high but not max to reduce airflow energy: from 1.0 → 0.9.
- Zone 2: Comfortable, CO2 fine and decreasing. We can trim airflow: 0.6 → 0.5.
- Zone 3: Comfortable, CO2 somewhat close to 1000 but decreasing; trim slightly but keep moderate: 0.75 → 0.65.
- Zone 4: Warmest zone (26.9°C) and we don’t want it to drift above 27°C as outdoor temp rises. Maintain or slightly increase flow to improve cooling; given we plan a small fan and coil reduction, better to increase its damper slightly: 0.8 → 0.85.

Net effect: Slightly reallocate relative airflow toward the warmest zone; overall total damper sum slightly reduced, which also helps reduce fan power.

5) OA damper adjustment:
- Currently 0.45 with outdoor at 33.9°C.
- CO2 levels are acceptable and trending down; no sign of approaching the 1100 ppm violation.
- Reduce OA damper to limit hot air intake and chiller load while keeping sufficient ventilation: 0.45 → 0.35.
This should still maintain or slowly improve CO2 based on current negative trends, especially with only a modest OA reduction.

6) Coil valve adjustment:
- Indoor temps are at or slightly above setpoint but stable; outdoor is hotter and rising.
- Dropping coil too much risks Zone 4 drifting above 27°C over the next 5 minutes.
- To save some chiller energy without losing comfort, make a modest reduction: 0.7 → 0.65. The zone dampers and fan will still provide adequate cooling, especially with a bit more flow to Zone 4.

7) Fan speed adjustment:
- Currently 0.8. With zones stable and only minor comfort issues, we can reduce fan power, which saves energy significantly.
- Dropping too far might slow CO2 removal and cooling, but a small change should be safe over 5 minutes.
- Move 0.8 → 0.7. This, together with slight damper rebalancing, should maintain comfort and CO2 while reducing power.

8) Check against bounds and finalise:
- Zone dampers bounds: [0.05, 1.0]. Proposed: [0.9, 0.5, 0.65, 0.85] → all within bounds.
- OA damper bounds: [0.05, 0.6]. Proposed: 0.35 → within bounds.
- Coil valve bounds: [0.06, 1.0]. Proposed: 0.65 → within bounds.
- Fan speed bounds: [0.45, 1.4]. Proposed: 0.7 → within bounds.

This action aims to keep all zones within the 25–27°C band (with extra help to Zone 4), keep CO2 under control (no sign of violation risk) and lower energy by modestly reducing OA, coil, and fan speed while slightly trimming some zones’ airflow.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.5, 0.65, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.65, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current conditions vs objectives:\n- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.\n- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, violation at > 1100 ppm.\n- Minimize fan/chiller/pump power.\n\nZone states:\n- Zone 1: T=26.2°C (well within band, slightly above setpoint), dT/dt≈0, CO2=1009 ppm (>1000, slightly high), CO2 trend=-3.7 ppm/min (decreasing).\n- Zone 2: T=26.1°C, stable, CO2=942 ppm (<1000), decreasing.\n- Zone 3: T=26.1°C, stable, CO2=967 ppm (<1000), decreasing.\n- Zone 4: T=26.9°C (near upper band limit but still within), stable, CO2=876 ppm, decreasing.\n\nOutdoor air: 33.9°C and rising quickly.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret objectives and current state
- Comfort target: 26°C with comfort band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, hard penalty if >1100 ppm.
- Minimise power (fan/chiller/pump), so avoid unnecessary high fan_speed, high coil_valve, and wide-open dampers.
- Next control horizon: 5 minutes.

Current zone conditions:
Zone 1: T=26.3°C (slightly warm, but within 25–27), dT/dt≈+0.01°C/min → in 5 min ≈+0.05 → ~26.35°C. CO2=1024 ppm, rising 2.7 ppm/min → +13.5 → ~1037.5 ppm. Already above 1000 and drifting further up. Needs more ventilation.
Zone 2: T=26.1°C, stable to slightly warming: +0.05 → ~26.15°C. CO2=950 ppm, +1.7/min → +8.5 → ~958.5 ppm. Close to target but ok.
Zone 3: T=26.2°C, +0.02/min → +0.1 → ~26.3°C. CO2=980 ppm, +2.4/min → +12 → ~992 ppm. Very close to 1000 and rising.
Zone 4: T=26.9°C (near top of band), +0.01/min → ~26.95°C. CO2=881 ppm, +1.0/min → +5 → ~886 ppm. Thermal is the main concern here.

Outdoor air: 34.6°C and rising sharply. So more OA brings significant cooling load and potential comfort risk if coil is not strong enough, but we do need some extra OA to combat high CO2 in Zones 1 and 3.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.9, 0.5, 0.65, 0.85]
  • Z1 and Z4 already quite open, Z2 moderate, Z3 moderately high.
- OA damper: 0.35 (mid).
- Coil valve: 0.65 (moderate-high cooling).
- Fan speed: 0.7 (moderate).

2) Trade-offs for next 5 minutes
CO2:
- Z1 is already >1000 ppm. Z3 is near 1000 with significant upward trend. We should prioritize extra ventilation to these two zones.
- Z2 and Z4 are safer; they still need ventilation but not as aggressively.
- Increasing zone dampers and OA damper plus fan speed improves CO2 but costs energy and adds latent/sensible load.
- We also must avoid approaching 1100 ppm to prevent a large violation penalty. For Z1: projected ~1037 at current settings; increasing ventilation should flatten or reverse this over the next 5–10 minutes.

Thermal:
- All zones will remain within 25–27°C over the next 5 minutes even with slight warming, but Z4 is close to the upper limit. We want a mild bias towards more cooling, especially for Z4.
- Outside is much hotter than inside, so more OA requires higher coil to maintain comfort.
- With current coil valve 0.65 and fan 0.7, temps are slightly rising, so net cooling is a bit insufficient. Increasing coil slightly is preferable to over-driving fan, because fan power escalates faster.

Power/efficiency:
- Reward penalizes power_kw with weight 0.2, so we should avoid big jumps in fan speed or OA damper unless needed for CO2 constraints.
- Given CO2 risk in Z1 and Z3, some increase in ventilation is justified. We'll aim for targeted zone damper adjustments plus a modest OA increase rather than a large fan increase.

3) Actuator strategy
Goals for this 5-min step:
- Nudge all zones slightly cooler to counter the upward drift, with special attention to Z4.
- Improve CO2 in Z1 and Z3 while keeping energy reasonable.

Zone dampers (0.05–1.0):
- Z1: High CO2 and slightly warm. Keep damper high or increase slightly to give more fresh air and cooling to that zone.
  • From 0.9 → 0.95 (near max, but not fully 1.0 to avoid overshoot and unnecessary flow).
- Z2: Near target both in temp and CO2. We can hold or tweak slightly. Keeping it at 0.5 seems fine to avoid excessive flow there; its CO2 is acceptable.
  • Keep at 0.5.
- Z3: CO2 near 1000 and rising; temp slightly high. Increase damper to improve ventilation.
  • From 0.65 → 0.8.
- Z4: Warmest zone; needs more cooling but CO2 is fine. It's already at 0.85.
  • Increase slightly to improve cooling: 0.85 → 0.9.

OA damper (0.05–0.6):
- Need more outdoor air for system-wide CO2 relief, but outside is very hot, so avoid a large increase.
- Current 0.35: a modest bump should help without dramatically increasing load.
  • Increase to 0.4 (small step, balancing CO2 vs chiller load).

Coil valve (0.06–1.0):
- Temps are drifting up even with 0.65. Higher OA and more airflow to Z1/Z3/Z4 require a bit more cooling.
- Increase moderately to reverse warming trend but not max it out.
  • 0.65 → 0.72 (a proportional nudge, giving stronger supply air cooling for the next 5 minutes).

Fan speed (0.45–1.4):
- More airflow helps both CO2 and comfort but raises fan power significantly.
- With zone dampers opened more and OA slightly increased, a small fan increase will reinforce better mixing and CO2 control.
  • 0.7 → 0.75: small increase to avoid a steep energy penalty while modestly boosting ventilation.

4) Check constraints and consistency
- Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.4 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.72 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4].

5) Expected effect over next 5 minutes
- Increased coil and slightly higher fan should stop the warming trend; Z4 likely moves down from 26.9 toward mid-upper 26s, improving comfort margin.
- Higher zone dampers for Z1 and Z3 plus increased OA fraction and fan should slow or reverse their CO2 rise, helping keep them closer to or below 1000 ppm and avoiding approach to the 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Power use increases modestly but is justified by better comfort and CO2 control; steps are incremental to avoid over-penalizing energy in the reward.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort vs. energy assessment:
- All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band. Errors are small: +0.3, +0.2, +0.2, +0.9°C above 26°C.
- Temperature trends are essentially flat. Zone 4 is slightly warm but still <27°C.
- Outdoor air is much hotter (34°C), so increasing airflow or OA significantly would raise sensible load and chiller/pump/fan energy.

2) CO2 assessment:
- Zone 1: 1023 ppm, slightly above 1000 target but trending down (-0.3 ppm/min). In 5 min, ~101.5 ppm drop → ~1007 ppm, close to target.
- Zone 2: 952 ppm with +0.3 ppm/min → about 953–954 ppm, still below target and well below violation.
- Zone 3: 975 ppm, decreasing (-0.9 ppm/min) → ~971 ppm.
- Zone 4: 876 ppm, decreasing strongly.
- All zones are safely below 1100 ppm violation threshold, and trends are either slightly rising but safe (Z2) or falling (Z1,3,4). No need for more OA; can likely reduce OA a bit to cut energy without crossing targets.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Maintain comfort around 26°C while slightly reducing plant energy.
- Avoid making any zone too warm, especially Zone 4 (already 26.9°C) and Zone 1 (26.3°C).
- Keep CO2 under control with minimal OA and balanced zone dampers; current CO2 levels and trends allow a modest OA reduction.

4) Actuator-by-actuator decisions (relative to previous action):
- Previous: zone_dampers [0.95, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9], oa_damper 0.4, coil_valve 0.72, fan_speed 0.75.

4a) Outdoor air damper:
- Outside is much hotter, and CO2 is acceptable and trending stable/down in most zones.
- Reducing OA slightly lowers cooling load and fan power while keeping enough ventilation for CO2.
- Move from 0.40 to 0.30 (still well above minimum 0.05), which should still ventilate adequately given sub-1000 ppm average CO2 and short 5-min horizon.

4b) Fan speed:
- All temperatures basically stable; we can slightly reduce fan speed to save energy but must not cause Zone 4 to heat much above 27°C.
- A small step down from 0.75 to 0.70 should maintain airflow sufficiently while reducing energy.

4c) Coil valve (cooling):
- With very hot outdoor air and a slight reduction in airflow (fan 0.70), overly reducing coil could let zones warm, especially Zone 4.
- To keep comfort near 26°C, maintain coil close to current but can nudge slightly down to reduce chiller use, relying on already cool mixed air and reduced OA load.
- Move from 0.72 to 0.68 for a modest energy cut while still providing strong cooling to counter 34°C outside.

4d) Zone dampers:
Goal: Slightly re-balance to help the warmer zone (Zone 4) while trimming excess airflow to cooler/safe zones to reduce fan and reheat needs.
- Zone 4 (26.9°C, trending flat, CO2 876 and falling): It is warmest; give it a bit more flow to nudge temperature back toward 26°C. Increase from 0.90 to 0.95.
- Zone 1 (26.3°C, flat, CO2 1023 and slowly decreasing): Slightly above CO2 target and just above 26°C. Keep airflow high to aid both cooling and CO2 dilution, but as CO2 is already trending down and we increased Z4, we can trim Z1 a bit to reduce overall flow and energy while not harming CO2 too much.
  - Reduce from 0.95 to 0.90.
- Zone 2 (26.2°C, slightly increasing, CO2 952 and slightly rising): Comfort and CO2 both fine. Keep roughly similar to maintain balance and not starve the zone.
  - Keep at 0.50.
- Zone 3 (26.2°C, flat, CO2 975 and dropping fast): Very safe on CO2, comfortable, and trending downward CO2.
  - We can reduce damper a bit to cut load and reallocate some capacity to Zone 4; from 0.80 to 0.70.

5) Check constraints and objectives:
- All actuators within bounds:
  - Zone dampers in [0.05, 1.0]: [0.90, 0.50, 0.70, 0.95] ✓
  - OA damper in [0.05, 0.60]: 0.30 ✓
  - Coil valve in [0.06, 1.0]: 0.68 ✓
  - Fan speed in [0.45, 1.4]: 0.70 ✓
- Expected effects:
  - Comfort: Slightly more cooling to Zone 4 via higher local damper and still-strong coil, despite lower OA/fan, should keep it near or under 27°C. Other zones remain near 26°C.
  - CO2: OA reduced but still non-minimal; CO2 levels are safe with some margins, and trends (esp. Z1,3,4) are downward or modest.
  - Energy: Reduced fan (0.70 vs 0.75), reduced OA (0.30 vs 0.40), and modestly reduced coil (0.68 vs 0.72) all lower energy while sustaining comfort/IAQ.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.
- Current temps: Z1 26.3, Z2 26.3, Z3 26.3, Z4 26.9°C. All are inside 25–27°C; Z4 is a bit warm but still in band. Temperature trends are flat (≈0°C/min), so without changes we expect temps to remain near current values over next 5 minutes.
- CO2: Z1 1045 ppm (above 1000 target, rising 4.1 ppm/min), Z2 965 (below target, rising moderately), Z3 992 (just under target, rising), Z4 889 (safely below, rising). Peak CO2 is in Zone 1 at 1045 > 1000 target, but < 1100 violation threshold. We should avoid crossing 1100 while nudging Z1 back toward 1000.
- Outdoor air: 33.3°C, well above zone temps; outdoor trend is cooling but still much hotter than indoors this interval. Extra outdoor air will increase sensible cooling load and can warm zones if coil/fan are not adjusted.
- Previous actuators: zone_dampers [Z1 0.9, Z2 0.5, Z3 0.7, Z4 0.95], oa_damper 0.3, coil_valve 0.68, fan_speed 0.7. This is relatively high airflow and cooling.

2) Trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are good and essentially steady. We should avoid overcooling (dropping toward <25°C) or warming above 27°C. Since outdoor air is hot, any OA increase must be accompanied by sufficient coil/fan to keep comfort.
- CO2 is the main concern: Z1 at 1045 and rising ~4 ppm/min could reach ~1065 in 5 minutes if ventilation effectiveness stays the same. That is still below the 1100 violation threshold but above the 1000 target; reward will incur CO2 penalty. We want to slightly increase effective ventilation and mixing, especially benefiting Z1 and Z3, without a large energy increase.
- Energy: we should minimally adjust from previous actions, ideally reduce coil and/or fan if comfort margins allow, but we must not compromise CO2 control.

3) Strategy by actuator:
- Zone dampers: Rebalance to give more fresh/cool flow to the zones that are CO2-constrained (Z1, Z3) and slightly less to better zones (Z2, Z4), while keeping total flow similar so fan speed can stay moderate.
  * Z1: already 0.9 but CO2 is high; keep high or slightly increase to prioritize ventilation. Raising to 0.95 will modestly increase flow without hitting max.
  * Z3: near target CO2 with upward trend; keep relatively high. Keep at 0.7 or nudge up a bit to 0.75.
  * Z2: CO2 reasonable; can slightly reduce from 0.5 to 0.45 to reallocate flow without harming comfort (temp 26.3, flat trend).
  * Z4: warmest temp (26.9) but low CO2. Reducing too much might raise its temp above 27, so only a small reduction from 0.95 to 0.9 to modestly save energy and reallocate capacity.
  Net effect: more relative flow to Z1 and Z3 vs Z2/Z4, small change overall.

- Outdoor air damper (oa_damper): Higher OA reduces CO2 but raises cooling load with 33.3°C air. Z1 CO2 is only modestly above target; a large OA increase would hurt energy and risk warming zones if coil/fan are not increased. The coil is already at 0.68, so we have cooling capacity. A modest OA increase from 0.30 to 0.35 should improve CO2 without a big energy penalty; we avoid going too high (e.g., >0.45) to keep sensible load controlled.

- Coil valve (cooling): Currently 0.68 with flat temps around 26.3–26.9. If we slightly increase OA, mixed-air temperature will rise, requiring a bit more cooling to maintain comfort and guard against Z4 rising above 27°C. A small increase to 0.72 should offset the additional OA heat while still controlling chiller energy. We avoid large increases since comfort is already adequate and we don't want to overcool zones into 25–26°C range aggressively.

- Fan speed: 0.7 is moderate and is helping CO2 dilution already. Increasing fan speed further will boost ventilation effectiveness and mixing but at a significant power cost (fan power roughly scales with speed^3 in many systems). Given we already increase OA fraction and rebalance dampers to favor high-CO2 zones, we can likely keep fan at 0.7. Reducing fan speed now would hurt CO2 and might push Z1 closer to 1100; not acceptable. So keep at 0.7.

4) Check against reward components:
- Comfort reward: Likely maintained or slightly improved, especially for Z4, which may cool slightly due to higher coil while its damper is only slightly reduced.
- Comfort penalty / band: All zones should remain within 25–27°C; coil increase prevents any warm drift from added OA, zone damper redistribution minor.
- CO2 penalty: OA increase + higher flow to Z1/Z3 should slow or reverse CO2 rise in Z1, keeping it closer to 1000 and comfortably below 1100, reducing co2_penalty and avoiding violation.
- Power: Small coil and OA increases slightly raise cooling and ventilation energy, but we avoided increasing fan speed; these moderate changes should be outweighed by gains in CO2 and comfort reward.

5) Bounds check (clip to given ranges):
- zone_dampers: [0.05, 1.0] → proposals (0.95, 0.45, 0.75, 0.9) are all within bounds.
- oa_damper: [0.05, 0.6] → 0.35 within bounds.
- coil_valve: [0.06, 1.0] → 0.72 within bounds.
- fan_speed: [0.45, 1.4] → 0.7 within bounds.

6) Final chosen actions: implement the modest OA and coil increase, reallocate zone dampers to favor high-CO2 zones, and keep fan speed unchanged.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.45, 0.75, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.72, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

A modest OA increase from 0.30 to 0.35 should improve CO2 without a big energy penalty; we avoid going too high (e.g., >0.45) to keep sensible load controlled.\n\n- Coil valve (cooling): Currently 0.68 with flat temps around 26.3–26.9. If we slightly increase OA, mixed-air temperature will rise, requiring a bit more cooling to maintain comfort and guard against Z4 rising above 27°C. A small increase to 0.72 should offset the additional OA heat while still controlling chiller energy. We avoid large increases since comfort is already adequate and we don't want to overcool zones into 25–26°C range aggressively.\n\n- Fan speed: 0.7 is moderate and is helping CO2 dilution already. Increasing fan speed further will boost ventilation effectiveness and mixing but at a significant power cost (fan power roughly scales with speed^3 in many systems). Given we already increase OA fraction and rebalance dampers to favor high-CO2 zones, we can likely keep fan at 0.7. Reducing fan speed now would hurt CO2 and might push Z1 closer to 1100; not acceptable. So keep at 0.7.\n\n4) Check against reward components:\n- Comfort reward: Likely maintained or slightly improved, especially for Z4, which may cool slightly due to higher coil while its damper is only slightly reduced.\n- Comfort penalty / band: All zones should remain within 25–27°C; coil increase prevents any warm drift from added OA, zone damper redistribution minor.\n- CO2 penalty: OA increase + higher flow to Z1/Z3 should slow or reverse CO2 rise in Z1, keeping it closer to 1000 and comfortably below 1100, reducing co2_penalty and avoiding violation.\n- Power: Small coil and OA increases slightly raise cooling and ventilation energy, but we avoided increasing fan speed; these moderate changes should be outweighed by gains in CO2 and comfort reward.\n\n5) Bounds check (clip to given ranges):\n- zone_dampers: [0.05, 1.0] → proposals (0.95, 0.45, 0.75, 0.9) are all within bounds.\n- oa_damper: [0.05, 0.6] → 0.35 within bounds.\n- coil_valve: [0.06, 1.0] → 0.72 within bounds.\n- fan_speed: [0.45, 1.4] → 0.7 within bounds.\n\n6) Final chosen actions: implement the modest OA and coil increase, reallocate zone dampers to favor high-CO2 zones, and keep fan speed unchanged."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimise power (fan/chiller/pump) while maintaining comfort and CO2.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.3°C (slightly above setpoint but well within band), dT/dmin=-0.01 (slowly cooling), CO2=1041 ppm (>1000), dCO2/dmin=-0.4 (slowly decreasing). Comfort acceptable; CO2 slightly high but trending down.
- Zone 2: T=26.4°C, dT/dmin=+0.02 (slowly warming), CO2=987 ppm (<1000), dCO2/dmin=+4.0 (rising, could cross 1000 soon).
- Zone 3: T=26.3°C, dT/dmin=+0.01 (slightly warming), CO2=1011 ppm (>1000), dCO2/dmin=+3.5 (rising, risk of going further above target and toward violation threshold if not controlled).
- Zone 4: T=26.9°C (near upper band), dT/dmin=-0.01 (very slowly cooling), CO2=889 ppm (good), dCO2/dmin≈0.

Outdoor:
- T_out=33°C, well above indoor temps; using more OA damper increases ventilation but adds sensible heat load, increasing coil and fan power.

Previous actuators:
- Zone dampers: [Z1=0.95, Z2=0.45, Z3=0.75, Z4=0.9]
- OA damper: 0.35
- Coil valve: 0.72
- Fan speed: 0.70

2) Anticipate 5‑minute evolution with no change:
Approx CO2 projections (linear for 5 min):
- Z1: 1041 + (-0.4*5) ≈ 1039 ppm (still above 1000, safe vs 1100).
- Z2: 987 + (4*5) ≈ 1007 ppm (slightly above target, below violation).
- Z3: 1011 + (3.5*5) ≈ 1028.5 ppm (further above target, below violation but trending upward).
- Z4: 889 + (0*5) ≈ 889 ppm.
No immediate violation risk in 5 minutes, but Z2 and Z3 likely to drift further above 1000 if ventilation not increased; reward has CO2_penalty_weight, so we want to at least stabilise or slightly reduce CO2 while avoiding large energy increases.

Thermal projections (5 min):
- Z1: 26.3 + (-0.01*5) ≈ 26.25°C (still comfortable, slight overshoot cool side but within band and near center).
- Z2: 26.4 + (0.02*5) ≈ 26.5°C (still within band, fine; slightly warm).
- Z3: 26.3 + (0.01*5) ≈ 26.35°C (fine).
- Z4: 26.9 + (-0.01*5) ≈ 26.85°C (still high but under 27°C upper band, slowly improving).
Core constraint: keep Z4 from exceeding 27°C while also improving CO2 in zones near/above 1000 ppm.

3) Control strategy reasoning:
Priority ordering:
1) Avoid CO2 violation (>1100 ppm) and large CO2 penalty.
2) Maintain all zones inside 25–27°C band and near 26°C.
3) Reduce energy if 1–2 are secure.

Assessing levers:
- Zone dampers: redistribute system airflow among zones without a big fan energy change; helps target ventilation and sensible cooling where needed.
- OA damper: more OA improves building-wide CO2 but increases coil and fan load due to 33°C outdoor air; use judiciously.
- Coil valve: controls supply air temperature via chilled-water valve; higher value = colder supply air & more chiller energy.
- Fan speed: changes total airflow and fan power (roughly cubic with speed). Small tweaks can meaningfully change energy.

Given current conditions:
- CO2 is only moderately above target for Z1 & Z3, and about to cross for Z2. No violation risk in 5 min, so we want modest CO2 improvement without over-ventilating.
- Temperatures are all inside band; only Z4 is close to upper limit. Cooling cannot be reduced much, especially for Z4.

Implications:
- Maintain or slightly increase effective airflow to zones with CO2 concerns (Z1, Z2, Z3), but we can rebalance.
- Avoid significantly increasing OA damper because outdoor is hot and we already have OA=0.35 (over 50% of range 0.05–0.6). However, a small increase might substantially help CO2 if fan speed and zone dampers direct that air efficiently.
- Keep coil valve near current level to ensure supply air stays sufficiently cool. Z4 especially benefits from more cooling airflow rather than warmer air.
- Fan speed can possibly stay the same or be nudged slightly up to help ventilation if we keep setpoints efficient; but increasing fan speed increases power, directly penalised. Since CO2 is moderately high, a slight increase may be justified if OA is not raised too much.

Given we already have relatively high zone dampers in Z1, Z3, and Z4 and moderate OA, an energy-conscious adjustment is:
- Rebalance Z4 a bit down (still high damper) because its temperature is high but trending down; we can free some airflow to Z2 and Z3 to improve their CO2 without increasing fan speed much.
- Slightly increase Z2 damper to mitigate its rising CO2 while not overheating.
- Maintain or very slightly adjust Z1 and Z3 dampers to keep them high for ventilation and cooling.
- Slightly increase OA damper to counter CO2 upward trends across multiple zones, but keep the change modest to avoid unnecessary cooling load.
- Keep coil valve roughly same or slightly increased to offset any OA increase and ensure Z4 doesn’t approach 27°C; but Z1 is already slightly above cooling center and trending downward, so a large coil increase may cause overcooling. Thus, maintain coil near 0.72.
- Keep fan speed at 0.70 for now: acceptable compromise between energy and ventilation, as we’re mostly rebalancing via dampers and a small OA change. Raising fan speed would significantly increase power; CO2 risk doesn’t justify that yet.

4) Concrete actuator selection within bounds:
Bounds:
- Zone dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
- OA damper: [0.05, 0.6]
- Coil valve: [0.06, 1.0]
- Fan speed: [0.45, 1.4]

Zone dampers adjustment:
- Z1: currently 0.95 with CO2=1041 (slightly high, trending down) and T cooling slowly. Keep high to maintain ventilation but can drop slightly to reduce unnecessary flow if we are balancing others. Choose 0.90: still very high ventilation, slight energy/airflow relief.
- Z2: currently 0.45 with CO2=987 and rising quickly. Increase for more fresh air and some cooling to keep temp in check. Choose 0.60: a noticeable bump without maxing it, improves CO2 trajectory.
- Z3: currently 0.75 with CO2=1011 rising. Keep or slightly increase to counter its upward trend. Choose 0.80: modest increase for better dilution and cooling.
- Z4: currently 0.90, T=26.9 and slowly cooling. We must ensure it doesn’t cross 27°C, but zone is already quite open. Given coil remains cool, slightly reducing to 0.85 will likely still maintain or improve its temperature due to overall system conditions, while shifting a bit of capacity to Z2/3. Choose 0.85.

OA damper:
- From 0.35, small increase to 0.40 to address building-wide CO2 trends in Z2/Z3, accepting modest extra cooling load. Still well below 0.6 upper bound and not a large jump.

Coil valve:
- From 0.72, maintain to keep supply air adequately cold for Z4 and to offset slightly warmer mixed air from higher OA. Going higher would increase chiller energy and might overcool some zones; lower could risk Z4 drifting up. Choose 0.72 unchanged.

Fan speed:
- From 0.70, keep constant; rebalancing dampers and slightly higher OA should be sufficient for CO2 within next 5 minutes. Avoid extra fan power. Choose 0.70.

5) Sanity check vs objectives:
- Comfort: All zones expected to stay within 25–27°C; Z4 has high damper and stable coil, so should gradually cool or at least not warm.
- CO2: Increased OA and higher dampers in Z2/Z3 should slow or reverse their CO2 rise, and Z1 remains highly ventilated. Violation threshold 1100 ppm should be comfortably avoided.
- Energy: Only OA damper and some zone dampers increased; fan speed and coil valve kept constant, so incremental energy rise is limited while improving CO2. This should yield a better overall reward trade-off.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Comfort target band: 25–27 °C, ideal 26 °C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy (fan/chiller/pumps) while meeting comfort/CO2.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.3 (slightly above 26 but within band), dT/dt≈0, CO2=1035 ppm (above 1000, decreasing slightly at -1.1 ppm/min → about -5 ppm over next 5 min, still ~1030). Needs more ventilation.
- Zone 2: T=26.4, slightly rising (0.01 °C/min → +0.05 °C over 5 min → ~26.45), CO2=994 ppm, rising 1.3 ppm/min → +6.5 ppm → ~1000.5 ppm (slightly over target). Needs at least maintained or slightly increased ventilation.
- Zone 3: T=26.4, similar to Zone 2, CO2=1018 ppm, rising 1.2 ppm/min → +6 ppm → ~1024 ppm (above target). Needs more ventilation.
- Zone 4: T=26.9 (near top of band), dT/dt≈0, CO2=883 ppm decreasing → ~878 ppm. Thermally warmest but acceptable; CO2 is fine.

Outdoor: 32.7 °C and trending down but still much hotter than zones, so outdoor air is a cooling penalty and latent load; however CO2 concerns require enough OA to avoid penalty/violation.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.9, 0.6, 0.8, 0.85]
- OA damper: 0.4 (on a 0.05–0.6 range)
- Coil valve: 0.72 (0.06–1.0)
- Fan speed: 0.7 (0.45–1.4)

2) Priorities for next 5 minutes:
- CO2: Z1 (1035, slightly decreasing) and Z3 (1018, rising) are above 1000; Z2 is about to cross 1000. Need to keep all comfortably below 1100 to avoid large violation penalty and reduce gradual CO2 penalty.
- Temperature: All zones are within 25–27, but slightly on the warm side. Z4 at 26.9 and nearly flat suggests we should not reduce cooling; small increase in cooling could pull Z4 back closer to 26.5–26.7. However, we should balance with energy cost.

3) Lever by lever reasoning:

3.1 Zone dampers:
- Increasing a zone damper gives that zone more supply air (thus more cooling and more ventilation). Energy cost rises somewhat due to more flow, but penalty of poor CO2 or comfort is typically higher.
- Zone 1 (T 26.3, CO2 1035 decreasing): Already high damper at 0.9. Since CO2 is trending down, we do not need more; we can hold or slightly reduce to shift some flow to other zones without hurting CO2 too much.
- Zone 2 (T 26.4 rising, CO2 994 rising): Needs modest increase in flow to prevent CO2 drifting above 1000 and to slow/stop temperature rise.
- Zone 3 (T 26.4 rising, CO2 1018 rising): Highest CO2 risk besides Zone 1; needs increased damper.
- Zone 4 (T 26.9 flat, CO2 good): Warmest zone, so we want to maintain or slightly increase for cooling, but since CO2 is fine, we don't need extra from a ventilation standpoint.

Trade-off: We can slightly rebalance – reduce Zone 1 damper a bit (CO2 falling and T acceptable), and use that capacity to boost Zone 2 and Zone 3, slightly nudge Zone 4 up or keep stable.

Proposed zone dampers:
- Zone 1: reduce from 0.90 → 0.80 (still high, keeps CO2 falling but allows some redistribution, modest energy savings).
- Zone 2: increase from 0.60 → 0.70 (improve CO2 and cooling, likely keeps CO2 around or just under target and stabilizes T).
- Zone 3: increase from 0.80 → 0.90 (largest increase due to CO2 above target and rising, plus slight temperature rise).
- Zone 4: keep at 0.85 (already high, warm and near upper band; we want to keep cooling strong but avoid further big increases in flow/energy).
All values within [0.05, 1.0].

3.2 Outdoor air (OA) damper:
- At 0.4 currently (on 0.05–0.6). Increasing OA will directly lower mixed air CO2 but increase cooling load because OA is at 32.7 °C.
- Given multiple zones around or above 1000 ppm with some rising trends, keeping OA at 0.4 might be borderline; but CO2 violation threshold is 1100, which is still comfortably far. The larger penalty is progressive CO2 penalty, but jumping OA too high (like 0.6) increases chiller load.
- Zone level CO2 is impacted by both OA fraction and each zone’s damper. Since we’re increasing dampers where CO2 is problematic, we can avoid a big OA increase. A modest bump from 0.40 → 0.45 adds some fresh air without maxing energy.

3.3 Coil valve (cooling capacity):
- At 0.72, zones are within band but trending slightly warm (especially Z2 & Z3 rising, Z4 high). To pull temps slightly downward toward 26 while offsetting the slightly increased OA damper and increased airflows in Z2/Z3/Z4, a slight coil increase is reasonable.
- Overcooling risk: Lower bound of comfort band is 25 °C; we’re currently ~26.3–26.9 with small positive drifts; the system’s 5-minute response will be moderate. A small step (0.72 → 0.75) should gently increase cooling without risk of dropping below 25 within 5 minutes.

3.4 Fan speed:
- At 0.7 (range 0.45–1.4). Higher fan speed increases flow and thus both cooling distribution and ventilation, but with cubic fan power relationship, it penalizes energy.
- Since we already adjust zone dampers and slightly increase OA, we may not need more fan speed. We can keep fan at 0.7 to avoid additional energy consumption.
- Slightly decreasing fan speed would save energy but likely worsen CO2 in already marginal zones; so hold at 0.7.

4) Check objectives against proposed action:
- Comfort: Slight coil increase plus higher dampers for Z2/Z3 and maintained high damper in Z4 should stabilize or slightly reduce temperatures, staying safely inside 25–27 and nudging toward 26.
- CO2: Z1 remains above 1000 but decreasing; Z2/3 get more supply plus slightly higher OA fraction, which should reduce or flatten their CO2 trajectory, keeping them below violation and likely closer to target over multiple intervals.
- Energy: Only modest changes: coil 0.72→0.75, OA 0.40→0.45, some redistribution of dampers, fan constant. This balances comfort/CO2 with restrained energy increase.
- All actuators are within provided bounds.

5) Final chosen setpoints (clipped to bounds):

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C centered at 26°C.
- Current zone temps:
  - Z1: 26.3°C (slightly warm, but within band, small error)
  - Z2: 26.4°C (slightly warm, within band)
  - Z3: 26.4°C (slightly warm, within band)
  - Z4: 26.9°C (near upper edge of band, warmest zone)
- Temperature trends are near flat: small positive drift in Z2/Z3, essentially zero elsewhere. With a hot outside (32.9°C rising), internal heat gains plus envelope will tend to push temps up unless we maintain some cooling.

2) CO2 assessment:
- Targets: keep below 1000 ppm, violation threshold 1100 ppm.
- Current CO2 and trends:
  - Z1: 1026 ppm, trend -1.6 ppm/min → over 5 min ≈ -8 ppm → projected ≈ 1018 ppm (still above 1000 but moving down).
  - Z2: 989 ppm, trend -1 ppm/min → ≈ -5 ppm → ≈ 984 ppm (comfortably below target).
  - Z3: 1015 ppm, trend -0.5 ppm/min → ≈ -2.5 ppm → ≈ 1012 ppm (slightly above target, slowly decreasing).
  - Z4: 872 ppm, trend -2 ppm/min → ≈ -10 ppm → ≈ 862 ppm (well below target).
- No zone is near 1100 ppm; we don't need aggressive ventilation to avoid violation penalty in the next 5 minutes.

3) Energy vs. IAQ trade-off:
- Power is penalized; we should reduce fan and cooling when comfort and CO2 allow.
- However, outdoor air is very hot (32.9°C). Bringing in more OA dilutes CO2 but increases sensible load on coil → higher chiller/pump power for same supply air temperature.
- Given that Z1 and Z3 are only slightly above CO2 target and already decreasing, it’s reasonable to maintain or slightly lower OA fraction, relying on existing ventilation and exhaust to keep CO2 trending down, while avoiding extra heat load.

4) Review previous action (to avoid big swings):
- Previous: zone_dampers = [0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.85], oa_damper = 0.45, coil_valve = 0.75, fan_speed = 0.7.
- This is a moderately high cooling/airflow setting.
- Conditions now are mostly within comfort with slight warm bias and some CO2 slightly above 1000 ppm.
- So we can modestly trim cooling and airflow to save energy while preserving comfort and CO2 trajectory.

5) Zone damper strategy:
- Objective: prioritize air to zones with higher temperature or CO2, slightly reduce where both are comfortable and CO2 is low.
- Z4 is warmest (26.9°C) but has the best CO2; keep its damper relatively high to bring cooling there.
- Z3 has slightly high CO2 and temp; keep damper fairly high.
- Z1 has highest CO2 (1026 ppm) and slightly warm; keep moderately high.
- Z2 has near-target CO2 (989) and moderate temp; can reduce a bit more to save some flow.
- Also reduce all slightly from previous to lower total airflow and fan power while relying on coil/fan to maintain temps.
- Proposed dampers (slightly reduced total, but biased to warmer/more CO2 zones):
  - Z1: reduce from 0.8 → 0.75
  - Z2: reduce more from 0.7 → 0.6
  - Z3: reduce slightly from 0.9 → 0.85
  - Z4: reduce slightly from 0.85 → 0.8
- All within bounds [0.05, 1.0].

6) Outdoor air damper:
- Hot outside, CO2 not critical. Higher OA raises coil load, so we should not increase OA.
- We can slightly reduce OA from 0.45 to about 0.4 to lower heat load while still providing substantial ventilation, which should keep CO2 trending downward given current negative trends.
- 0.4 is within bounds [0.05, 0.6]. This small change avoids transients.

7) Coil valve (cooling capacity):
- Coil valve is at 0.75. Zones are slightly above setpoint and outside is significantly hotter with rising trend. If we cut cooling too much, temps may drift above 27°C over upcoming intervals.
- To save energy but preserve comfort, reduce slightly, e.g., to 0.7, coupled with modest fan speed. Cooling capacity usually scales nonlinearly; a small drop should still maintain zone temps since current errors are small and trends are flat.
- 0.7 is within [0.06, 1.0].

8) Fan speed:
- At 0.7 currently, min is 0.45. With slightly reduced dampers and slightly lower coil valve, we should avoid a big fan reduction so that supply air distribution remains adequate and CO2 keeps decreasing.
- To reduce power modestly, set fan_speed ~0.65 (small step down). This reduces fan energy without significantly hurting comfort/IAQ in 5 minutes.
- 0.65 is within [0.45, 1.4].

9) Sanity check vs. objectives:
- Comfort: Still in band, with slight warm bias; small reductions in coil and fan are unlikely to drive temps beyond 27°C within 5 minutes, given small current drifts and still-strong cooling.
- CO2: All zones currently below violation threshold with negative trends. Slight OA reduction and slightly lower airflow should not reverse trends dramatically over 5 minutes, especially since damper priorities favor zones with higher CO2.
- Energy: Slightly lower coil_valve, fan_speed, OA fraction, and some zone dampers → lower chiller, fan, and maybe pump energy, improving reward.

With slightly reduced dampers and slightly lower coil valve, we should avoid a big fan reduction so that supply air distribution remains adequate and CO2 keeps decreasing.\n- To reduce power modestly, set fan_speed ~0.65 (small step down). This reduces fan energy without significantly hurting comfort/IAQ in 5 minutes.\n- 0.65 is within [0.45, 1.4].\n\n9) Sanity check vs. objectives:\n- Comfort: Still in band, with slight warm bias; small reductions in coil and fan are unlikely to drive temps beyond 27°C within 5 minutes, given small current drifts and still-strong cooling.\n- CO2: All zones currently below violation threshold with negative trends. Slight OA reduction and slightly lower airflow should not reverse trends dramatically over 5 minutes, especially since damper priorities favor zones with higher CO2.\n- Energy: Slightly lower coil_valve, fan_speed, OA fraction, and some zone dampers → lower chiller, fan, and maybe pump energy, improving reward.\n\n10) Final action values (clipped to bounds):\n- zone_dampers: [0.75, 0.6, 0.85, 0.8]\n- oa_damper: 0.4\n- coil_valve: 0.7\n- fan_speed: 0.65"",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Key observations:
- All zone temperatures are within the 25–27°C comfort band but slightly above the 26°C comfort center:
  - Z1: 26.3°C (slightly warm, trending +0.01°C/min)
  - Z2: 26.5°C (warmer, +0.01°C/min)
  - Z3: 26.5°C (warmer, +0.01°C/min)
  - Z4: 26.9°C (near upper band, flat trend)
- CO2:
  - Z1: 1035 ppm and rising 1.6 ppm/min → projected in 5 min ≈ 1043 ppm
  - Z2: 997 ppm and rising 1.5 ppm/min → ≈ 1005 ppm (crosses 1000 target)
  - Z3: 1022 ppm and rising 1.3 ppm/min → ≈ 1029 ppm
  - Z4: 872 ppm and nearly flat → ≈ 872 ppm
- Several zones are already above the 1000 ppm CO2 target, and trends are upward. Need more fresh air to avoid higher CO2 penalties and reduce risk of hitting 1100 ppm violation threshold in coming intervals.
- Outdoor air is hot (33°C) and rising; increasing OA raises cooling load, so any OA increase should be paired with sufficient cooling capacity and balanced fan speed.
- Previous actions:
  - Zone dampers: [0.75, 0.6, 0.85, 0.8]
  - OA damper: 0.4 (mid‑high within [0.05, 0.6])
  - Coil valve: 0.7 (strong cooling)
  - Fan speed: 0.65 (moderate)

2) Control objectives trade‑off:
- Temperatures: Slightly warm and drifting warmer; we should not relax cooling. Might modestly increase cooling delivery to keep temps near 26, but avoid overcooling or excessive energy.
- CO2: The dominant concern for the upcoming interval is CO2 in Zones 1–3. We want to:
  - Increase total outdoor air fraction somewhat.
  - Direct more supply air to the high‑CO2 zones (1–3), especially 1 and 3 (highest CO2) and 2 (about to exceed target).
  - Zone 4 has good CO2 and is close to upper comfort limit; reducing its airflow slightly should still be okay while saving some energy and allowing more fraction to high‑need zones.
- Energy: Avoid unnecessarily high fan speed or coil valve; small, targeted adjustments from current state should approximate a near‑optimal trade‑off versus step changes.

3) Zone damper reasoning:
- Zone 1: 26.3°C, 1035 ppm, both slightly warm and over CO2 target with rising trend. Need more airflow for both sensible cooling and dilution.
  - Increase damper moderately above 0.75 to get more cooled, fresh air. Not to max, to avoid overpriority and energy spikes.
  - Choice: 0.85.
- Zone 2: 26.5°C, 997 ppm (will cross 1000), rising temp and CO2.
  - Increase from 0.6 to provide more cooling and dilution, but slightly less than Zone 1 and 3 because its CO2 is marginally better.
  - Choice: 0.7.
- Zone 3: 26.5°C, 1022 ppm, rising.
  - Very similar to Zone 1 on CO2 side and temp; increase airflow comparably.
  - It was already high at 0.85; raise slightly but not to 1.0.
  - Choice: 0.9.
- Zone 4: 26.9°C, CO2 872 ppm and stable. It is warm but with good air quality. Increasing cool airflow would help temperature but would also dilute the share of air to worse zones and increase fan energy.
  - Given stronger CO2 issue in other zones, we can modestly reduce its damper from 0.8, accepting a small comfort sacrifice in Z4 to improve system‑wide reward.
  - Choice: 0.7 (still relatively high, maintains comfort while freeing capacity).
- Resulting damper setpoints: [0.85, 0.7, 0.9, 0.7]. All within [0.05, 1.0].

4) Outdoor air damper reasoning:
- CO2 in multiple zones is above target and trending up. Increasing OA fraction improves IAQ but increases load because outdoor is 33°C (hotter than zones).
- Previous OA: 0.4, range [0.05, 0.6]. We already have moderate OA; we can justify a modest increase to mitigate CO2 without going to max.
- Given that CO2 is only slightly above target and violation threshold is 1100 ppm (still some margin), a moderate increase provides a good trade‑off.
- Choice: 0.5 (a 0.1 increment). This increases fresh air but avoids the full 0.6, limiting extra cooling energy.

5) Coil valve reasoning:
- Indoor temps are within band but drifting up slightly. Outdoor temp is high and rising; increased OA and higher zone airflow will increase cooling load.
- Current coil valve: 0.7. If we increase OA and total flow (via fan and dampers), the mixed air temp and coil load rise; without more coil opening, zone temps might climb toward upper band.
- Slight increase in coil opening should keep average supply air temp low enough to pull zones toward 26°C center.
- Choice: 0.75 (small bump up from 0.7 to support extra OA and airflow while considering energy weight).

6) Fan speed reasoning:
- Current fan speed: 0.65 (bounds [0.45, 1.4]). With several dampers opening more and OA fraction increasing, we might see higher pressure drops; raising fan speed slightly maintains adequate flow to all zones and better CO2 removal.
- Higher fan power is penalized, but small increments can significantly help CO2 and temperature.
- Choice: 0.7, a modest rise that supports airflow without a large power jump.

7) Sanity checks and bounds:
- zone_dampers: [0.85, 0.7, 0.9, 0.7] → within [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.5 → within [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve: 0.75 → within [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.7 → within [0.45, 1.4].

8) Expected effect over next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures: Slight downward or stabilized trend towards ~26–26.5°C due to stronger cooling and more airflow, keeping all within comfort band.
- CO2: Slower rise or stabilization in Zones 1–3 because of increased OA and zone airflow; reduced risk of approaching 1100 ppm, and move closer to or below 1000 ppm over subsequent intervals.
- Energy: Slightly increased cooling and fan energy vs previous step, but targeted to cut comfort and CO2 penalties, likely improving net reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.7, 0.9, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.5, ""coil_valve"": 0.75, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and temperature assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C around a 26°C center.
- Current zone temperatures:
  • Zone 1: 26.3°C (0.3°C above setpoint, well inside band), flat trend (0.0°C/min).
  • Zone 2: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint), flat trend.
  • Zone 3: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint), very slightly rising (0.01°C/min ≈ +0.05°C in 5 min).
  • Zone 4: 26.9°C (0.9°C above setpoint, close to upper limit), very slightly rising (0.01°C/min ≈ +0.05°C in 5 min).
- In 5 minutes, if we did nothing substantial, temperatures stay within 25–27°C, but Zone 4 could drift closer to 27°C, so we should slightly favor more cooling/airflow to avoid approaching the edge of the band, without overshooting or wasting energy.

2) CO2 assessment:
- CO2 targets: keep below 1000 ppm, violation threshold 1100 ppm.
- Current values and trends (ppm, delta per minute):
  • Zone 1: 1014 ppm, trending −3.9 ppm/min → over 5 min ≈ −19.5 ppm → ~994 ppm (back under target).
  • Zone 2: 982 ppm, trending −2.7 ppm/min → ≈ −13.5 ppm → ~968 ppm.
  • Zone 3: 1010 ppm, trending −2.4 ppm/min → ≈ −12 ppm → ~998 ppm (just under target).
  • Zone 4: 865 ppm, trending −1.5 ppm/min → ≈ −7.5 ppm → ~857 ppm.
- CO2 is slightly above target in Zones 1 and 3 right now but already decreasing at current OA and airflow. No sign of approaching the 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Conclusion: we do not need to increase outdoor air fraction; we can even reduce OA slightly to save energy while still allowing CO2 to continue trending downward due to existing mixing and time lag.

3) Energy and outdoor conditions:
- Outdoor temperature: 33.1°C and rising (+1.2°C/h) → outdoor air is significantly hotter than indoor (26–27°C). Bringing in more OA air imposes a higher cooling load.
- Current actuator values:
  • Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.7, 0.9, 0.7]
  • OA damper: 0.5 (quite high given hot outdoor conditions)
  • Coil valve: 0.75 (substantial cooling output)
  • Fan speed: 0.7
- Reward penalizes both power (fan/chiller/pumps) and CO2, so we must balance: maintain comfort and CO2 under 1000 ppm while minimizing unnecessary OA intake and excessive cooling.

4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are in band and only slightly above setpoint; we want gentle cooling, not aggressive changes.
- CO2 is already trending down in all zones with OA=0.5; given hot outdoor air, we can modestly reduce OA to reduce chiller load while relying on ongoing dilution and system dynamics to keep CO2 under control.
- Fan energy: lowering fan speed reduces power but might slightly reduce zone airflow and mixing. However, with only mild temperature and CO2 needs, we can trim it slightly while staying safe.
- Coil valve: with outdoor at 33.1°C, supply air must remain cool enough to nudge zones slightly downward, particularly Zone 4. Slightly reducing OA while keeping coil close to prior level should maintain cooling with lower total load.
- Zone-specific airflow adjustments:
  • Zone 4 is warmest (26.9°C) and still creeping upward, so maintain or slightly increase its damper to improve local cooling.
  • Zones 1 and 3 are warm-ish and have highest CO2, so keep their dampers high to maintain both cooling and ventilation effectiveness.
  • Zone 2 is comfortably in band and CO2 is below 1000 and dropping; we can slightly reduce its damper to save some airflow without comfort risk.

5) Concrete adjustments (small, conservative moves from previous action):
- Zone dampers:
  • Zone 1: keep at 0.85 (support CO2 and gentle cooling).
  • Zone 2: decrease slightly from 0.7 to 0.65 (still ample airflow, saves some fan/coil work).
  • Zone 3: keep at 0.9 (CO2 just over target, temp slightly high; prioritize airflow).
  • Zone 4: increase slightly from 0.7 to 0.75 to counter it being closest to upper comfort limit.
- OA damper:
  • Reduce from 0.5 to 0.45. This cuts some hot outdoor load but should still keep CO2 trending down since current trends are already negative and we’re not making drastic changes.
- Coil valve:
  • Slightly increase cooling from 0.75 to 0.78 to ensure Zone 4 does not drift beyond 27°C and to gently pull all zones a bit closer to 26°C without overshooting.
- Fan speed:
  • Reduce slightly from 0.7 to 0.68. This trims fan power modestly while keeping sufficient airflow given that temperatures are already in band and zone dampers are mostly high.

6) Check against bounds and objectives:
- Bounds:
  • Zone dampers must be in [0.05, 1.0] → all proposed values (0.85, 0.65, 0.9, 0.75) are valid.

  • Coil valve in [0.06, 1.0] → 0.78 is valid.
  • Fan speed in [0.45, 1.4] → 0.68 is valid.
- Objectives:
  • Comfort: Slightly higher cooling and airflow to warmer zones should keep all zones comfortably within 25–27°C, with a mild move toward the 26°C center.
  • CO2: Already trending down; modest OA reduction is unlikely to reverse that over 5 minutes, especially as damper positions for higher-CO2 zones remain high.
  • Energy: Lower OA fraction and slightly reduced fan speed diminish power use, while coil valve is only marginally higher than before, net likely improving reward due to reduced ventilation load and fan power.

Overall, these actions balance comfort, CO2 management, and energy use for the upcoming 5-minute interval, with small, safe adjustments from the previous state.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.65, 0.9, 0.75], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.78, ""fan_speed"": 0.68}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1) Comfort and temperature assessment:\n- Comfort band is 25–27°C around a 26°C center.\n- Current zone temperatures:\n  • Zone 1: 26.3°C (0.3°C above setpoint, well inside band), flat trend (0.0°C/min).\n  • Zone 2: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint), flat trend.\n  • Zone 3: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint), very slightly rising (0.01°C/min ≈ +0.05°C in 5 min).\n  • Zone 4: 26.9°C (0.9°C above setpoint, close to upper limit), very slightly rising (0.01°C/min ≈ +0.05°C in 5 min).\n- In 5 minutes, if we did nothing substantial, temperatures stay within 25–27°C, but Zone 4 could drift closer to 27°C, so we should slightly favor more cooling/airflow to avoid approaching the edge of the band, without overshooting or wasting energy.\n\n2) CO2 assessment:\n- CO2 targets: keep below 1000 ppm, violation threshold 1100 ppm.\n- Current values and trends (ppm, delta per minute):\n  • Zone 1: 1014 ppm, trending −3.9 ppm/min → over 5 min ≈ −19.5 ppm → ~994 ppm (back under target).\n  • Zone 2: 982 ppm, trending −2.7 ppm/min → ≈ −13.5 ppm → ~968 ppm.\n  • Zone 3: 1010 ppm, trending −2.4 ppm/min → ≈ −12 ppm → ~998 ppm (just under target).\n  • Zone 4: 865 ppm, trending −1.5 ppm/min → ≈ −7.5 ppm → ~857 ppm.\n- CO2 is slightly above target in Zones 1 and 3 right now but already decreasing at current OA and airflow. No sign of approaching the 1100 ppm violation threshold.\n- Conclusion: we do not need to increase outdoor air fraction; we can even reduce OA slightly to save energy while still allowing CO2 to continue trending downward due to existing mixing and time lag.\n\n3) Energy and outdoor conditions:\n- Outdoor temperature: 33.1°C and rising (+1.2°C/h) → outdoor air is significantly hotter than indoor (26–27°C). Bringing in more OA air imposes a higher cooling load.\n- Current actuator values:\n  • Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.7, 0.9, 0.7]\n  • OA damper: 0.5 (quite high given hot outdoor conditions)\n  • Coil valve: 0.75 (substantial cooling output)\n  • Fan speed: 0.7\n- Reward penalizes both power (fan/chiller/pumps) and CO2, so we must balance: maintain comfort and CO2 under 1000 ppm while minimizing unnecessary OA intake and excessive cooling.\n\n4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:\n- Temperatures are in band and only slightly above setpoint; we want gentle cooling, not aggressive changes.\n- CO2 is already trending down in all zones with OA=0.5; given hot outdoor air, we can modestly reduce OA to reduce chiller load while relying on ongoing dilution and system dynamics to keep CO2 under control.\n- Fan energy: lowering fan speed reduces power but might slightly reduce zone airflow and mixing. However, with only mild temperature and CO2 needs, we can trim it slightly while staying safe.\n- Coil valve: with outdoor at 33.1°C, supply air must remain cool enough to nudge zones slightly downward, particularly Zone 4. Slightly reducing OA while keeping coil close to prior level should maintain cooling with lower total load.\n- Zone-specific airflow adjustments:\n  • Zone 4 is warmest (26.9°C) and still creeping upward, so maintain or slightly increase its damper to improve local cooling.\n  • Zones 1 and 3 are warm-ish and have highest CO2, so keep their dampers high to maintain both cooling and ventilation effectiveness.\n  • Zone 2 is comfortably in band and CO2 is below 1000 and dropping; we can slightly reduce its damper to save some airflow without comfort risk.\n\n5) Concrete adjustments (small, conservative moves from previous action):\n- Zone dampers:\n  • Zone 1: keep at 0.85 (support CO2 and gentle cooling).\n  • Zone 2: decrease slightly from 0.7 to 0.65 (still ample airflow, saves some fan/coil work).\n  • Zone 3: keep at 0.9 (CO2 just over target, temp slightly high; prioritize airflow).\n  • Zone 4: increase slightly from 0.7 to 0.75 to counter it being closest to upper comfort limit.\n- OA damper:\n  • Reduce from 0.5 to 0.45. This cuts some hot outdoor load but should still keep CO2 trending down since current trends are already negative and we’re not making drastic changes.\n- Coil valve:\n  • Slightly increase cooling from 0.75 to 0.78 to ensure Zone 4 does not drift beyond 27°C and to gently pull all zones a bit closer to 26°C without overshooting.\n- Fan speed:\n  • Reduce slightly from 0.7 to 0.68. This trims fan power modestly while keeping sufficient airflow given that temperatures are already in band and zone dampers are mostly high.\n\n6) Check against bounds and objectives:\n- Bounds:\n  • Zone dampers must be in [0.05, 1.0] → all proposed values (0.85, 0.65, 0.9, 0.75) are valid.\n  • OA damper in [0.05, 0.6] → 0.45 is valid.\n  • Coil valve in [0.06, 1.0] → 0.78 is valid.\n  • Fan speed in [0.45, 1.4] → 0.68 is valid.\n- Objectives:\n  • Comfort: Slightly higher cooling and airflow to warmer zones should keep all zones comfortably within 25–27°C, with a mild move toward the 26°C center.\n  • CO2: Already trending down; modest OA reduction is unlikely to reverse that over 5 minutes, especially as damper positions for higher-CO2 zones remain high.\n  • Energy: Lower OA fraction and slightly reduced fan speed diminish power use, while coil valve is only marginally higher than before, net likely improving reward due to reduced ventilation load and fan power.\n\nOverall, these actions balance comfort, CO2 management, and energy use for the upcoming 5-minute interval, with small, safe adjustments from the previous state."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret objectives and current state:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize power (fan, chiller via coil, pumps via flow implied by fan).

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.3°C (slightly above setpoint but within band), dT/dt=0.0°C/min (stable), CO2=1008 ppm (slightly above target, just below 1000+ band), CO2 trending down (-1 ppm/min).
- Zone 2: T=26.6°C, slightly warm, slowly warming, CO2=981 ppm (within target, slowly decreasing).
- Zone 3: T=26.5°C, slightly warm, slowly warming, CO2=1007 ppm (slightly above target but already decreasing).
- Zone 4: T=27.0°C, at upper comfort limit, warming slightly, CO2=862 ppm (good, decreasing).

Outdoor conditions:
- T_out=33.2°C, rising (trend +1.2°C/hr). Outdoor air is much hotter than indoors, so increasing OA too much is costly for cooling.

Previous actuators:
- Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.65, 0.90, 0.75]
  * Zones 1 and 3 are getting a lot of air; Zones 2 and 4 moderate.
- OA damper: 0.45 (fairly high given hot outdoor air).
- Coil valve: 0.78 (substantial cooling, hence significant chiller energy).
- Fan speed: 0.68 (moderate).

2) Key trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are all within comfort band, but trending slightly warm in Zones 2–4, and Z4 is at 27°C upper limit. We should maintain or slightly improve cooling to prevent drift above 27°C, especially as outdoor temperature is high and rising.
- CO2 in Zones 1 (~1008 ppm) and 3 (~1007 ppm) is slightly above 1000 ppm but trending downward already with current OA/fan/zone flows. We want to keep below 1100 ppm to avoid violation. With negative CO2 trends, we can safely reduce a bit of OA to save energy, as long as we keep enough ventilation.
- Energy: Coil at 0.78 seems stronger than required since zone temps are near target. Some reduction in coil and possibly dampers or fan is possible, but must not let Z4 exceed 27°C.

3) Strategy by actuator:

3.1 Zone dampers (0.05–1.0): adjust per-zone airflow distribution for comfort and CO2.
- Zone 1: T=26.3 (slightly warm but stable), CO2 just above target. Cooling and ventilation are both slightly needed, but not excessively. Prior damper 0.85 is quite high. Given CO2 is already trending down and above-target only slightly, we can modestly reduce to save fan and reheat energy while still providing good flow.
  -> Reduce Z1 damper moderately: 0.85 → 0.80.

- Zone 2: T=26.6 (warmish), CO2=981 good. Slight warming trend. We should not reduce airflow; a slight increase in cooling airflow can help pull it closer to 26°C without needing large extra coil valve.
  -> Slightly increase damper: 0.65 → 0.70.

- Zone 3: T=26.5 (warmish), CO2=1007 slightly high but trending down. Prior damper is 0.90 (very high). Given both temperature and CO2 are only slightly above ideal, 0.90 is probably more than needed. We can reduce slightly to save energy while still keeping strong flow.
  -> Lower gently: 0.90 → 0.85.

- Zone 4: T=27.0 (upper limit) with positive temp trend, CO2 good. This is the critical zone for avoiding comfort penalty. We should slightly increase airflow to bring it back toward 26–26.5°C.
  -> Increase damper a bit: 0.75 → 0.80.

Net effect: Shift some airflow from Z1 and Z3 to Z2 and Z4, focusing on warmer zones, without big changes that might destabilize.

3.2 Outdoor air damper (0.05–0.6): balance CO2 vs cooling load.
- With OA=0.45 and hot outdoor air at 33.2°C, there is significant enthalpy penalty. Z1 and Z3 CO2 are slightly above 1000 ppm but already declining. With fan speed not too low and zone dampers still relatively high, we can afford a modest reduction in OA fraction while likely keeping CO2 below 1000 or at least trending there.
- Reducing OA too aggressively risks CO2 slow-down and potential future violation. A modest step down from 0.45 to around 0.40 should reduce coil load and fan load (cooling mixed air) without compromising indoor air quality over 5 minutes.
  -> Set OA damper: 0.40.

3.3 Coil valve (0.06–1.0): cooling capacity / chiller energy.
- All zones are in band but slightly on warm side, with one (Z4) at upper limit. Outdoor is hot and rising, so building heat gain is positive. If we cut coil too much, temperatures may drift above 27°C, especially in Z4.
- Previous coil=0.78; likely can be reduced modestly while relying on slightly rebalanced dampers and existing fan speed to maintain temps.
- A small reduction to ~0.74–0.75 eases chiller energy while still providing strong cooling.
  -> Choose 0.75 as a conservative small step down.

3.4 Fan speed (0.45–1.4): affects airflow, pressure, fan power, and effective ventilation.
- Currently 0.68 (moderate). CO2 trends are all negative, and we are increasing dampers in warmer zones; we also slightly reduced Z1 and Z3 dampers, which may slightly reduce total flow. Lower fan speed decreases power but can increase CO2 and temperatures.
- Given Z4 is at 27°C and we are slightly lowering coil, it is safer not to decrease airflow; a small increase might be considered for comfort, but that would increase power. Since reward penalizes energy, and comfort is currently acceptable, hold fan speed constant.
  -> Keep fan at 0.68.

4) Check constraints and expected effects:
- Zone dampers all within [0.05, 1.0]: [0.80, 0.70, 0.85, 0.80] ✓
- OA damper 0.40 in [0.05, 0.6] ✓
- Coil valve 0.75 in [0.06, 1.0] ✓
- Fan speed 0.68 in [0.45, 1.4] ✓

Expected 5-min evolution:
- Temperatures: Slightly reduced coil but more airflow to warmest zones should keep all within 25–27°C, likely nudging Z2–Z4 slightly cooler or at least preventing further warming beyond the upper limit.
- CO2: With OA only slightly reduced (0.45 → 0.40) and negative CO2 trends already present, CO2 in Z1 and Z3 should stay near or below current levels and remain well under 1100 ppm, avoiding violation penalty. Some zones may hover near 1000 ppm, which is acceptable given energy savings.
- Energy: Lower coil valve and OA fraction reduce chiller load; keeping fan speed stable avoids extra fan power while not risking comfort.

This combination aims to slightly improve energy efficiency while maintaining comfort and air quality within the reward design priorities.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.7, 0.85, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.75, ""fan_speed"": 0.68}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- CO₂ target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize power via lower fan, cooling, and damper openings while meeting above.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 26.3°C (inside band, slightly warm vs 26°C), temp trend 0.0°C/min → stable. CO₂ 1014 ppm, rising 1.2 ppm/min → projected in 5 min ≈ 1020 ppm, still below 1100 but above 1000 target.
- Zone 2: 26.6°C (warm side), trend +0.01°C/min → ≈26.65°C, still acceptable. CO₂ 984 ppm, rising 0.5 ppm/min → ≈986 ppm, just under target.
- Zone 3: 26.6°C (warm), trend +0.01°C/min → ≈26.65°C. CO₂ 1014 ppm, rising 1.3 ppm/min → ≈1020 ppm.
- Zone 4: 27.0°C (at upper band edge), flat trend. CO₂ 863 ppm, slowly rising → ≈864 ppm.

Outdoor: 33°C, trending down but still much hotter than 26°C setpoint, so additional outdoor air increases sensible cooling load. Need enough OA for CO₂ control but avoid excessive OA that drives coil/fan energy.

Previous actuators:
- Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.7, 0.85, 0.8]
- OA damper: 0.4
- Coil valve: 0.75
- Fan speed: 0.68
Temperatures are slightly warm and either flat or drifting up. This suggests current cooling and airflow are close but a bit low for ideal 26°C, and zones with higher CO₂ (1 & 3) might benefit from more airflow.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Thermal: All zones are within band but on warm side, with Zone 4 at the top of band and not cooling. To avoid drifting above 27°C, modestly increase cooling delivery, prioritizing Zone 4 and slightly increasing system cooling capacity.
- CO₂: Zones 1 & 3 are slightly over the 1000 ppm target and rising modestly. Short term risk of crossing 1100 ppm within 5 minutes is very low, but continued upward trend is undesirable. Slight increase in OA and airflow to these zones should help without a big energy penalty.
- Energy: Avoid large increases in fan or coil. Use targeted damper tweaks and only modest increments in coil and OA. Fan can stay similar because temperatures are warm and we want a bit more zone ventilation; a very small bump is acceptable.

3) Zone damper adjustments (bounds 0.05–1.0):
Reasoning:
- Zones 1 & 3: slightly over CO₂ target and warmish. Increase slightly to deliver more cool, fresh air.
- Zone 2: near target CO₂, warmish but controlled; slight reduction vs others to save energy but not too much.
- Zone 4: warmest (27°C) with stable temp; increase damper to promote more cooling.

Adjustments from previous:
- Zone 1: 0.8 → 0.85 (small increase; within 0.05–1.0).
- Zone 2: 0.7 → 0.68 (tiny decrease to trim flow/energy a bit while staying comfortable).
- Zone 3: 0.85 → 0.9 (small increase for highest CO₂ growth).
- Zone 4: 0.8 → 0.9 (prioritize cooling to keep it from exceeding 27°C).

4) Outdoor air damper (bounds 0.05–0.6):
Current OA = 0.4. With outdoor at 33°C, more OA means more coil load, but we want slightly better CO₂ control for Zones 1 & 3. A small increase should help without large energy penalty.
- Set OA damper: 0.4 → 0.45 (modest increase, well below 0.6 upper bound).

5) Coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0):
Current = 0.75. All zones on warm side, some drifting up. Slightly more cooling is warranted, but big increases would hurt power.
- Set coil valve: 0.75 → 0.8 (moderate increase for a bit more cooling capacity, still far from 1.0).

6) Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4):
Current = 0.68. More airflow would improve cooling distribution and CO₂ dilution, but fan power is significant. Since we are already increasing zone dampers and coil, keep fan nearly the same with a minimal bump for better mixing and ventilation.
- Set fan speed: 0.68 → 0.7 (small increase; still low relative to max, managing energy use).

7) Check bounds and final values:
- Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.68, 0.9, 0.9] → all between 0.05 and 1.0.
- OA damper: 0.45 → between 0.05 and 0.6.
- Coil valve: 0.8 → between 0.06 and 1.0.
- Fan speed: 0.7 → between 0.45 and 1.4.

These actions aim to pull temperatures slightly toward 26°C, mitigate CO₂ creep in Zones 1 & 3, protect Zone 4 from exceeding 27°C, and only modestly increase power, which should improve the overall reward over the coming 5-minute interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.68, 0.9, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and CO2 status:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C.
  • Zone 1: 26.3°C (slightly warm vs 26°C center, inside band). Temp trend 0.0°C/min → stable.
  • Zone 2: 26.6°C (warm side, inside band). Trend +0.01°C/min → very slightly warming.
  • Zone 3: 26.6°C (same as Zone 2, warm side). Trend +0.01°C/min.
  • Zone 4: 27.0°C (at upper band edge, slightly high). Trend ~0.0°C/min.
- CO2 vs 1000 ppm target:
  • Zone 1: 1009 ppm, slightly above target, decreasing at -1.1 ppm/min.
  • Zone 2: 981 ppm, just below target, decreasing.
  • Zone 3: 1011 ppm, slightly above target, decreasing at -0.6 ppm/min.
  • Zone 4: 854 ppm, well below target, decreasing.
- No zone is near the 1100 ppm violation threshold, and CO2 is trending down everywhere. Primary constraint now is to avoid overheating while not wasting energy.

2) Outdoor and current plant state:
- Outdoor temp: 32.7°C, trending down but still significantly hotter than indoor (≈26–27°C). So outdoor air is a heat source, not useful for free cooling; OA should be kept moderate: just enough to control CO2.
- Previous actions:
  • Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.68, 0.9, 0.9]
  • OA damper: 0.45 (on a 0.05–0.6 range)
  • Coil valve: 0.8 (fairly strong cooling)
  • Fan speed: 0.7 (moderate)
- With these settings, zone temps are stable/slightly warming on the warm side of the band, so we should slightly increase net cooling delivered but avoid big jumps that raise fan/pump/chiller power too much.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Cooling coil:
  • Zones are near the top half of the band; Zone 4 is at upper limit. We want a gentle nudge cooler, not aggressive overcooling.
  • Increase coil valve slightly from 0.8 to ~0.85 to add a bit more cooling capacity while not dramatically increasing chiller load.
- Fan speed:
  • More airflow improves both cooling delivery and CO2 dilution but costs fan energy.
  • CO2 is already decreasing and below/near target, so no need to push fan much higher.
  • The warm-side bias suggests we can benefit from a small increase to move cool air better, but keep close to current value to limit energy: 0.72 (slight bump from 0.7).
- OA damper:
  • Outdoor is 32.7°C, so more OA raises sensible load.
  • CO2 is trending down and only slightly above 1000 ppm in Zones 1 and 3; violation threshold is 1100 ppm, and we are >80 ppm below that.
  • We can modestly reduce OA to save cooling energy while still ensuring CO2 will continue down due to existing ventilation and trends.
  • Move OA from 0.45 to 0.40 (small reduction), still well above minimum 0.05.
- Zone dampers (distribution):
  • Goal: shift available cool air to hotter / higher CO2 zones while not over-ventilating cooler/cleaner ones.
  • Zone 1: 26.3°C & 1009 ppm, slightly warm and slightly above CO2 target. Keep fairly open, maybe tiny reduction to balance overall airflow since fan + coil are increased.
    - From 0.85 → 0.8.
  • Zone 2: 26.6°C & 981 ppm, warm but CO2 fine. Needs cooling but not extra OA specifically. We can slightly increase damper to get more cool air from central system.
    - From 0.68 → 0.72.
  • Zone 3: 26.6°C & 1011 ppm, warm and slightly high CO2. This zone most justifies more flow (for both cooling and dilution), but outdoor air fraction is set centrally; local damper just increases total supply.
    - From 0.9 → 0.95 (near upper bound but not maxed).
  • Zone 4: 27.0°C & 854 ppm, at temperature upper limit but low CO2. Needs more cooling but not fresh air specifically. Since we’re already giving it high flow (0.9), keep similar or slightly adjust.
    - Keep at 0.9. That plus slightly stronger coil and fan should help bring it down or at least prevent overshoot above 27°C.
- Bounds check (per action_bounds):
  • Zone dampers: between 0.05 and 1.0 → chosen values [0.8, 0.72, 0.95, 0.9] are all valid.
  • OA damper: 0.05–0.6 → 0.4 is valid.
  • Coil valve: 0.06–1.0 → 0.85 is valid.
  • Fan speed: 0.45–1.4 → 0.72 is valid.

4) Expected effect on reward:
- Comfort_reward: Slightly cooler supply and redistributed flow should pull zones gently toward 26°C center without overshooting below 25°C in the short 5-min horizon.
- Comfort_penalty: Reducing the warm bias (especially in Zone 4 at 27°C) should reduce penalty.
- Power_weight * power_kw: Coil and fan increases will raise energy, but OA reduction and targeted damper changes should partially offset load. Given the strong penalty for discomfort (comfort_penalty=2), a small energy increase is justified to avoid drifting hotter.
- CO2-related terms: OA slightly reduced but fan slightly increased and CO2 already trending downward. With no zone near 1100 ppm, the risk of violation penalty is low; CO2_ppm should continue to fall, keeping penalties modest.

Overall, this action aims for a modest increase in cooling effectiveness, slightly lower OA fraction to reduce unnecessary heat load, and redistribution of flow to warmer / marginally higher-CO2 zones to improve comfort and maintain air quality without a large energy penalty.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.72, 0.95, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.85, ""fan_speed"": 0.72}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band but slightly warm vs 26°C center:
  • Zone 1: 26.3°C (error +0.3, flat trend)
  • Zone 2: 26.6°C (error +0.6, flat trend)
  • Zone 3: 26.7°C (error +0.7, slightly rising 0.01°C/min)
  • Zone 4: 26.9°C (error +0.9, flat)
  Temperatures are drifting warm or flat, outdoor is very hot (33.6°C and rising fast), so heat gain pressure is upwards. We need to maintain or slightly increase cooling to avoid drifting above 27°C, especially in Zones 3–4.

- CO2:
  • Zone 1: 1012 ppm, increasing (+0.5 ppm/min) – already above 1000 target.
  • Zone 2: 980 ppm, slightly decreasing.
  • Zone 3: 1013 ppm, increasing (+0.3 ppm/min) – above target.
  • Zone 4: 854 ppm, flat.
  Peak CO2 is ~1013 ppm, below 1100 ppm violation, but Zones 1 & 3 are above the 1000 ppm target with rising trends. We should modestly improve ventilation to slow/stop CO2 rise but avoid big energy impact, since outdoor air is very hot.

- Previous actuators:
  • Zone dampers: [0.80, 0.72, 0.95, 0.90]
  • OA damper: 0.40 (range 0.05–0.6)
  • Coil valve: 0.85 (range 0.06–1.0)
  • Fan speed: 0.72 (range 0.45–1.4)

Given high outdoor temperature, outside air is thermally expensive: more OA -> more cooling load and energy. We must balance CO2 penalties vs energy and comfort.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures: Slightly too warm, with upward tendency due to hot outdoor. We should keep strong but not excessive cooling.
  • Coil valve: Currently high at 0.85. If we reduce it, zones will likely warm and potentially exceed 27°C, especially Zone 4 at 26.9°C. Given comfort importance (Gaussian around 26°C, penalty 2.0) we should at least maintain coil, maybe increase slightly to preempt warming while OA fraction may rise.
  • Fan speed: At 0.72, giving substantial airflow; increasing fan helps distribute cooling and ventilation but increases power. Since we may increase OA slightly, a small fan increase can support both CO2 control and comfort. However, big jumps would hurt power.

- CO2: Zones 1 & 3 above 1000 ppm and rising.
  • OA damper: Currently 0.40 of max 0.6. Raising OA modestly will help reduce CO2 over the next 5 min, but each increment adds load due to 33.6°C outdoor air. A moderate step (e.g., to ~0.45) balances CO2 penalty reduction with energy cost.

- Zone dampers:
  • We want to prioritize airflow to warmer / higher-CO2 zones (1, 3, 4) and perhaps slightly deprioritize Zone 2 (already cooler and CO2 trending down).
  • Changes should be incremental to avoid instability and unnecessary fan energy; damper bounds are wide (0.05–1.0), but we can stay near previous values and bias slightly.

3) Concrete adjustments:
- OA damper: Increase from 0.40 → 0.45.
  Rationale: Slightly more fresh air to slow/stop CO2 rise in Zones 1 & 3, without jumping to very high OA that would drive up cooling energy.

- Coil valve: Increase slightly 0.85 → 0.88.
  Rationale: Counteract additional thermal load from higher OA and the upward temperature pressure (hot outdoors, some zones near upper comfort bound). Small increase helps keep all zones below 27°C and maybe nudges them closer to 26°C.

- Fan speed: Slight bump 0.72 → 0.75.
  Rationale: Slightly more airflow to distribute added cooling and increased OA for CO2 control. This is a modest increase to limit fan power increase while improving both comfort and IAQ.

- Zone dampers:
  • Zone 1: 0.80 → 0.82 (slight increase to address being warmish and high CO2).
  • Zone 2: 0.72 → 0.70 (very small decrease; still plenty of air but nudges more capacity toward others).
  • Zone 3: 0.95 → 0.96 (already high; small nudge to maximize supply to a warm, high-CO2 zone without hitting 1.0 yet).
  • Zone 4: 0.90 → 0.92 (warmest zone; more air helps cooling, CO2 still fine but thermal comfort is key).
All values stay within [0.05, 1.0] and are small, smooth adjustments from the previous action to avoid overshoot.

4) Check against reward components:
- Comfort_reward / band_penalty: Slight extra cooling and airflow should keep all zones solidly within the 25–27°C band and ideally trending toward ~26°C, improving comfort reward and reducing penalties.
- CO2 penalties: Slight OA and fan increases, plus more flow to high-CO2 zones, should flatten or reduce CO2 in Zones 1 & 3, reducing CO2 penalty and helping avoid approaching 1100 ppm.
- Power_weight: There is a modest increase in coil, fan, and OA, but these are small steps. The expected gain in comfort and CO2 is likely worth the limited extra energy, especially since we are close to thermal and IAQ limits.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Comfort target: 26°C with comfort band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy via lower fan speed / coil valve / damper openings while maintaining comfort and air quality.

Current zone conditions:
- Z1: 26.3°C (slightly above 26 but well within 25–27 band), temp stable (0.0 °C/min). CO2 = 1002 ppm, slightly above 1000 but trending down at -1.9 ppm/min.
- Z2: 26.7°C (upper side of band), trending slightly up (0.01 °C/min). CO2 = 973 ppm, decreasing.
- Z3: 26.7°C, similar to Z2. CO2 = 1004 ppm, slightly above 1000, decreasing at -1.7 ppm/min.
- Z4: 26.9°C, top of comfort band, basically flat trend. CO2 = 845 ppm, decreasing.

Outdoor: very hot at 34.5°C and rising quickly. That implies outdoor air brings substantial sensible load; we should not increase OA unnecessarily.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.82, 0.70, 0.96, 0.92] (quite open, especially Z3/Z4).
- OA damper: 0.45 (moderately high given very hot outside air).
- Coil valve: 0.88 (strong cooling).
- Fan speed: 0.75 (moderate).

2) CO2 and OA strategy:
- Z1 and Z3 are marginally above the 1000 ppm target, but both trending down at ~1.8 ppm/min; over 5 minutes that’s ~9 ppm drop, which should bring them below 1000 ppm even if ventilation is slightly reduced.
- The violation threshold is 1100 ppm, so we have margin; current values ~1000 ppm with negative trends indicate we can slightly reduce OA damper and still stay below target and far from violation.
- Higher OA would significantly increase cooling load because outdoor is ~34.5°C vs an indoor target of 26°C. Given negative CO2 trends, reducing OA is reasonable to save chiller and fan energy.
- Action: reduce OA damper moderately from 0.45 to about 0.38 to cut load while keeping enough fresh air, relying on existing negative CO2 trend.

3) Temperature and cooling strategy:
- All zones are within the 25–27°C band; Z2–Z4 are on the warm side, but still acceptable. The comfort reward is steep around 26°C (sigma 0.25), but we shouldn’t overcool because energy is penalized.
- With strong coil valve (0.88) and moderate fan (0.75), Z4 is already slightly cooling (trend ~0). Reducing coil a bit should still keep temps within band over the next 5 minutes, especially since outdoor is hot and we are not trying to drive zones down to 25°C.
- To avoid overshooting cooler than 25°C and to save energy, reduce coil valve modestly, e.g. from 0.88 to 0.82. This should maintain or slightly decrease zone temperatures, likely keeping them in 26–27°C range.

4) Fan speed and zone damper strategy:
- Fan speed 0.75 with large zone damper openings suggests reasonably high airflow. Given that CO2 is trending down and temperatures are in band, we can slightly reduce total air volume without compromising comfort.
- Fan power typically scales nonlinearly with speed, so even a small reduction yields noticeable savings. Lowering from 0.75 to ~0.72 should reduce energy while still maintaining enough mixing and ventilation, especially because OA is only modestly reduced.
- Zone-level adjustments:
  - Z1: Slightly above 26°C and CO2 just above 1000 but decreasing. We should maintain decent airflow to help CO2 and not let temperature rise. Keep damper roughly similar or slightly adjusted around 0.80.
  - Z2: 26.7°C, trending slightly up, CO2 below 1000. Needs some cooling, so keep damper moderately open, e.g. ~0.72 (slightly above previous 0.70 to bias a bit more cooling with somewhat lower fan).
  - Z3: 26.7°C, CO2 just above 1000, decreasing. This is the most OA/vent-sensitive zone together with Z1. Its damper was 0.96; still needs good airflow for both cooling and CO2, but we can edge it down slightly to save energy while still prioritizing it relative to others, e.g. ~0.93.
  - Z4: 26.9°C, nearly 27°C, with low CO2. It needs cooling but not much outside air specifically. Keep damper fairly open to provide sensible cooling but trim slightly, say from 0.92 to 0.88, relying on coil and fan to cool without excessive airflow.

- Overall logic: maintain relatively high dampers in warmer/marginal-CO2 zones, small trims across the board, and a small fan reduction to balance comfort and energy.

5) Safety and bounds check:
- Action bounds:
  - zone_dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
  - oa_damper: [0.05, 0.6]
  - coil_valve: [0.06, 1.0]
  - fan_speed: [0.45, 1.4]
- Proposed values are within these bounds; clip if necessary (none exceed bounds).

6) Final compromise for reward:
- Slightly reduce OA damper, coil valve, and fan speed to reduce energy.
- Keep all zone dampers relatively high with minor individual tuning to protect comfort and CO2 in Zones 1 and 3.
- Expectation: Temperatures remain within 25–27°C, CO2 in all zones drop below 1000 ppm without approaching 1100, and power consumption decreases versus the previous interval, thereby increasing the overall reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.72, 0.93, 0.88], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.82, ""fan_speed"": 0.72}","{

We should maintain decent airflow to help CO2 and not let temperature rise. Keep damper roughly similar or slightly adjusted around 0.80.\n  - Z2: 26.7°C, trending slightly up, CO2 below 1000. Needs some cooling, so keep damper moderately open, e.g. ~0.72 (slightly above previous 0.70 to bias a bit more cooling with somewhat lower fan).\n  - Z3: 26.7°C, CO2 just above 1000, decreasing. This is the most OA/vent-sensitive zone together with Z1. Its damper was 0.96; still needs good airflow for both cooling and CO2, but we can edge it down slightly to save energy while still prioritizing it relative to others, e.g. ~0.93.\n  - Z4: 26.9°C, nearly 27°C, with low CO2. It needs cooling but not much outside air specifically. Keep damper fairly open to provide sensible cooling but trim slightly, say from 0.92 to 0.88, relying on coil and fan to cool without excessive airflow.\n\n- Overall logic: maintain relatively high dampers in warmer/marginal-CO2 zones, small trims across the board, and a small fan reduction to balance comfort and energy.\n\n5) Safety and bounds check:\n- Action bounds:\n  - zone_dampers: [0.05, 1.0]\n  - oa_damper: [0.05, 0.6]\n  - coil_valve: [0.06, 1.0]\n  - fan_speed: [0.45, 1.4]\n- Proposed values are within these bounds; clip if necessary (none exceed bounds).\n\n6) Final compromise for reward:\n- Slightly reduce OA damper, coil valve, and fan speed to reduce energy.\n- Keep all zone dampers relatively high with minor individual tuning to protect comfort and CO2 in Zones 1 and 3.\n- Expectation: Temperatures remain within 25–27°C, CO2 in all zones drop below 1000 ppm without approaching 1100, and power consumption decreases versus the previous interval, thereby increasing the overall reward."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and temperature assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C with center at 26°C.
- Zone temperatures:
  - Zone 1: 26.4°C (slightly warm, +0.4°C), trend +0.01°C/min → about +0.05°C over 5 min → ~26.45°C.
  - Zone 2: 26.7°C (warm, +0.7°C), trend +0.01°C/min → ~26.75°C.
  - Zone 3: 26.7°C (warm, +0.7°C), trend +0.01°C/min → ~26.75°C.
  - Zone 4: 26.9°C (upper edge of band), flat trend → ~26.9°C.
All zones are inside the 25–27°C comfort band but trending slightly warmer. Outdoor air is very hot at 34.4°C, so more outdoor air hurts cooling load. Thus, we should maintain or slightly increase cooling capacity and airflow to nudge temperatures down or at least stop the upward drift, while being cautious about energy.

2) CO2 status and risk:
- Target/soft limit: 1000 ppm; violation threshold: 1100 ppm with heavy penalty.
- Current CO2:
  - Zone 1: 1009 ppm, trend +1.3 ppm/min → +~6.5 ppm in 5 min → ~1015–1016 ppm (already above target, approaching violation if trend continues longer).
  - Zone 2: 975 ppm, trend +0.6 ppm/min → ~978 ppm (near target, rising).
  - Zone 3: 1009 ppm, trend +1.0 ppm/min → ~1014 ppm.
  - Zone 4: 850 ppm, trend +0.9 ppm/min → ~855 ppm.
Zones 1 and 3 are already above the target 1000 ppm; 2 is near; 4 is safe. We must prioritize avoiding 1100 ppm violation: that suggests some increase in ventilation (OA damper and zone dampers for high-CO2 zones), balanced against high outdoor temperature and power penalties.

3) Actuator implications:
- Zone dampers (0.05–1.0): Higher value → more supply air to zone, improving both cooling and dilution of CO2, but increases fan power somewhat and may reduce air available to other zones depending on system behavior. We can slightly up dampers in Zones 1 and 3 (high CO2) and perhaps maintain or modestly lower those in less critical zones to manage total flow.
- OA damper (0.05–0.6): Increased OA improves building-wide CO2 but adds hot air, raising cooling load. Current OA = 0.38 (mid-high). Since Zone 1 and 3 CO2 are just over target and trending up, and we have not yet approached 1100 ppm, a moderate increase in OA is warranted to flatten CO2 trend without going to the max, in order to limit cooling energy.
- Coil valve (0.06–1.0): Controls cooling capacity. Currently 0.82 (high). Temperatures are slightly warm and drifting up; outdoor is very hot. Reducing cooling now would likely increase temps toward the upper band, which will incur comfort penalty. However, full 0.82 may be more than needed. A slight reduction may balance energy without losing control, especially if we modestly raise fan speed and redistribute air.
- Fan speed (0.45–1.4): Higher speed improves distribution, cooling delivery, and CO2 dilution but increases fan energy. Currently 0.72 (moderate). Given CO2 is slightly high and temps are near upper band, a small increase can help with both comfort and air quality.

4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
Objectives:
- Prevent CO2 in Zones 1 and 3 from drifting toward 1100 ppm; try to bring them back closer to 1000 ppm range.
- Maintain all temperatures within 25–27°C and reduce warm drift, especially Zones 2–4.
- Avoid excessive power: avoid max OA, fan, or coil unless clearly needed.

Planned moves:
- Zone 1 damper: already 0.80. Increase slightly to improve cooling and CO2 dilution, but not to max to limit fan impact. Choose ~0.85.
- Zone 2 damper: at 0.72, temp 26.7°C and CO2 975 ppm. Slightly warm and near CO2 target. Maintain or small increase for better cooling without overdoing flow. Choose ~0.74.
- Zone 3 damper: high CO2 and warm; currently 0.93 (already high). Small increase to boost dilution and cooling, but avoid full 1.0 to keep some headroom and not spike fan load. Choose ~0.96.
- Zone 4 damper: temp at top of band (26.9°C) but CO2 is low. We want a bit more cooling but don’t need more ventilation. However, more zone airflow both cools and mixes. Since others are already higher, we can hold or slightly reduce to balance system airflow while not sacrificing too much comfort. Because 26.9°C is close to 27°C, we should not cut too much. Slight reduction from 0.88 to 0.86 to bias flow toward Zones 1 and 3 while still giving good cooling.

- OA damper: Currently 0.38. CO2 is trending upward and already slightly above target in two zones. To avoid future violations, gently increase OA but avoid big jumps because outdoor is 34.4°C. A move to ~0.42 represents a modest increase in ventilation.

- Coil valve: Currently 0.82 with all zones slightly warm and drifting up. Because OA is hot and we’re increasing it slightly, lowering coil too much would push temps up. To save some energy while maintaining comfort, a small reduction to ~0.80 is reasonable; combined with slightly higher airflows, effective cooling should remain similar.

- Fan speed: Currently 0.72. To improve both cooling delivery and CO2 dilution system-wide, a small increase is justified. Move to ~0.76 (still far from max 1.4, moderate energy impact).

5) Bounds check and clipping:
- Zone dampers must be within [0.05, 1.0]:
  - Z1: 0.85 → within bounds.
  - Z2: 0.74 → within bounds.
  - Z3: 0.96 → within bounds.
  - Z4: 0.86 → within bounds.
- OA damper [0.05, 0.6]: 0.42 → within bounds.
- Coil valve [0.06, 1.0]: 0.80 → within bounds.
- Fan speed [0.45, 1.4]: 0.76 → within bounds.

6) Expected outcome over 5 min:
- Slightly higher zone flows (especially in Zones 1 and 3) and slightly higher fan speed should reduce or flatten temperature increases and improve CO2 dilution.
- Modestly higher OA should flatten CO2 trends and help keep peak CO2 safely below violation threshold in the near term.
- Slightly reduced coil valve offsets some of the added energy use from higher fan and OA, balancing power while maintaining comfort.

This combination should improve the reward: better comfort and CO2 with moderate, not excessive, energy use.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.74, 0.96, 0.86], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.76}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- Comfort: All zones are within the comfort band (25–27°C) but slightly warm relative to 26°C setpoint:
  - Z1: 26.4°C (error +0.4, flat trend)
  - Z2: 26.7°C (error +0.7, flat)
  - Z3: 26.8°C (error +0.8, very slight warming)
  - Z4: 26.9°C (error +0.9, flat)
- CO2:
  - Z1: 1002 ppm, decreasing ~5.5 ppm over next 5 min → will be just under 1000.
  - Z2: 969 ppm, decreasing → safely below 1000.
  - Z3: 1004 ppm, decreasing ~4.5 ppm → will be just under 1000.
  - Z4: 847 ppm, decreasing → safely below 1000.
  - All are below 1100 ppm, so no violation penalty expected if ventilation is not aggressively reduced.
- Outdoor: 34.2°C and hot; more OA increases both cooling load and supply air temperature demand, so we don’t want to over-ventilate.
- Previous action:
  - Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.74, 0.96, 0.86]
  - OA damper: 0.42
  - Coil valve: 0.8
  - Fan speed: 0.76
  This is fairly aggressive cooling and airflow.

2) Objective trade-offs:
- Temperatures are slightly above 26°C but within comfort band; reward design has a strong comfort focus near 26°C with sigma 0.25, so modest cooling to pull zones back toward 26°C is valuable.
- CO2 is already trending down across all zones and close to the 1000 ppm target. Raising ventilation slightly might accelerate CO2 reduction but increases energy use, while current downward trends suggest we can maintain or even slightly reduce OA without crossing 1000 ppm in the very short term.
- Energy: coil valve at 0.8 and fan at 0.76 suggest room to reduce power while still slightly improving or maintaining comfort because all temperatures are only ~0.4–0.9°C above setpoint and not rising.

3) Zone-level strategy:
- Z3 and Z4 are warmest; Z1 is coolest; Z2 moderate.
- All zones show flat or slightly decreasing/warming trends near zero, indicating the system is roughly steady-state at the current settings.
- To reduce total airflow and energy while preserving comfort, we can bias more flow towards the warmest zones and ease off slightly on the cooler ones.
- However, zone damper changes should be modest to avoid overshoot in a 5-minute window.

4) OA damper strategy:
- Z1: 1002 ppm, trending down.
- Z3: 1004 ppm, trending down.
- Both are effectively at target and improving without extra OA.
- With outdoor at 34.2°C, more OA raises cooling load and could hurt energy efficiency.
- Slightly reducing OA from 0.42 to around 0.38–0.40 should still maintain downward CO2 trajectories while trimming load.
  - To stay conservative w.r.t. CO2 target and avoid any possible rebound, choose only a small reduction (e.g., 0.40) rather than a large one.

5) Coil valve strategy:
- With all zones slightly warm but stable, we want a bit more cooling effect per unit airflow if we intend to reduce fan speed.
- Reducing coil valve reduces chiller load but risks comfort drift upward, especially with hot outdoor air.
- Since we will slightly lower fan speed and slightly lower OA (thus slightly warmer return air fraction but less hot OA load), a small *increase* in coil valve can maintain or gently improve comfort with lower fan power.
- Current 0.8 → adjust to ~0.82–0.85 for a mild increase in cooling capacity without going to maximum.
  - Choose 0.83 as a balanced step.

6) Fan speed strategy:
- Fan at 0.76 currently; power term is explicitly penalized.
- Given all temperatures are well inside band and not rising, and CO2 is declining, we can reduce airflow somewhat to save fan energy while slightly increasing coil cooling to maintain comfort.
- A modest reduction (e.g., 0.76 → 0.72) should reduce energy without causing a large comfort degradation over 5 minutes.
  - We must respect lower bound 0.45, so 0.72 is safe.

7) Zone damper adjustments:
- Goal: Slightly favor warmest zones (Z3, Z4), slightly trim the cooler ones (Z1, Z2) to maintain overall mass flow roughly similar while we modestly reduce fan.
- Current: [0.85, 0.74, 0.96, 0.86]
  - Z3 is already very open; Z4 also high.
- Proposed small changes:
  - Z1 (26.4°C, coolest and near target): reduce from 0.85 → 0.80 to shift some capacity to warmer zones and reduce its cooling slightly.
  - Z2 (26.7°C): slight reduction from 0.74 → 0.72 to keep airflow but save a bit.
  - Z3 (26.8°C, warm, near highest CO2): keep high or even slightly up to maintain strong cooling and ventilation: 0.96 → 0.97.
  - Z4 (26.9°C, warm but good CO2): slight increase from 0.86 → 0.88.
- These are small enough to avoid abrupt dynamic changes but bias air toward warmer zones.

8) Check against bounds and objectives:
- Bounds:
  - Zone dampers: [0.05, 1.0] → 0.80, 0.72, 0.97, 0.88 all valid.
  - OA damper: [0.05, 0.6] → 0.40 valid.
  - Coil valve: [0.06, 1.0] → 0.83 valid.
  - Fan speed: [0.45, 1.4] → 0.72 valid.
- Expected effects next 5 minutes:
  - Comfort: Slightly more cooling effectiveness in warm zones via coil + damper bias, even with a small fan reduction, should gently pull temps toward 26°C or at least prevent warming.
  - CO2: OA slightly down but still moderate (0.40 vs 0.42) plus existing downward CO2 trends suggests CO2 should stay below or converge to target; still well below violation threshold.
  - Energy: Lower fan and slightly lower OA should reduce fan and chiller/pump energy; coil is raised a bit, but net should be favorable given strong penalty on power and that fan power scales nonlinearly with speed.

9) Final chosen action:

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current state:\n- Comfort: All zones are within the comfort band (25–27°C) but slightly warm relative to 26°C setpoint:\n  - Z1: 26.4°C (error +0.4, flat trend)\n  - Z2: 26.7°C (error +0.7, flat)\n  - Z3: 26.8°C (error +0.8, very slight warming)\n  - Z4: 26.9°C (error +0.9, flat)\n- CO2:\n  - Z1: 1002 ppm, decreasing ~5.5 ppm over next 5 min → will be just under 1000.\n  - Z2: 969 ppm, decreasing → safely below 1000.\n  - Z3: 1004 ppm, decreasing ~4.5 ppm → will be just under 1000.\n  - Z4: 847 ppm, decreasing → safely below 1000.\n  - All are below 1100 ppm, so no violation penalty expected if ventilation is not aggressively reduced.\n- Outdoor: 34.2°C and hot; more OA increases both cooling load and supply air temperature demand, so we don’t want to over-ventilate.\n- Previous action:\n  - Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.74, 0.96, 0.86]\n  - OA damper: 0.42\n  - Coil valve: 0.8\n  - Fan speed: 0.76\n  This is fairly aggressive cooling and airflow.\n\n2) Objective trade-offs:\n- Temperatures are slightly above 26°C but within comfort band; reward design has a strong comfort focus near 26°C with sigma 0.25, so modest cooling to pull zones back toward 26°C is valuable.\n- CO2 is already trending down across all zones and close to the 1000 ppm target. Raising ventilation slightly might accelerate CO2 reduction but increases energy use, while current downward trends suggest we can maintain or even slightly reduce OA without crossing 1000 ppm in the very short term.\n- Energy: coil valve at 0.8 and fan at 0.76 suggest room to reduce power while still slightly improving or maintaining comfort because all temperatures are only ~0.4–0.9°C above setpoint and not rising.\n\n3) Zone-level strategy:\n- Z3 and Z4 are warmest; Z1 is coolest; Z2 moderate.\n- All zones show flat or slightly decreasing/warming trends near zero, indicating the system is roughly steady-state at the current settings.\n- To reduce total airflow and energy while preserving comfort, we can bias more flow towards the warmest zones and ease off slightly on the cooler ones.\n- However, zone damper changes should be modest to avoid overshoot in a 5-minute window.\n\n4) OA damper strategy:\n- Z1: 1002 ppm, trending down.\n- Z3: 1004 ppm, trending down.\n- Both are effectively at target and improving without extra OA.\n- With outdoor at 34.2°C, more OA raises cooling load and could hurt energy efficiency.\n- Slightly reducing OA from 0.42 to around 0.38–0.40 should still maintain downward CO2 trajectories while trimming load.\n  - To stay conservative w.r.t. CO2 target and avoid any possible rebound, choose only a small reduction (e.g., 0.40) rather than a large one.\n\n5) Coil valve strategy:\n- With all zones slightly warm but stable, we want a bit more cooling effect per unit airflow if we intend to reduce fan speed.\n- Reducing coil valve reduces chiller load but risks comfort drift upward, especially with hot outdoor air.\n- Since we will slightly lower fan speed and slightly lower OA (thus slightly warmer return air fraction but less hot OA load), a small *increase* in coil valve can maintain or gently improve comfort with lower fan power.\n- Current 0.8 → adjust to ~0.82–0.85 for a mild increase in cooling capacity without going to maximum.\n  - Choose 0.83 as a balanced step.\n\n6) Fan speed strategy:\n- Fan at 0.76 currently; power term is explicitly penalized.\n- Given all temperatures are well inside band and not rising, and CO2 is declining, we can reduce airflow somewhat to save fan energy while slightly increasing coil cooling to maintain comfort.\n- A modest reduction (e.g., 0.76 → 0.72) should reduce energy without causing a large comfort degradation over 5 minutes.\n  - We must respect lower bound 0.45, so 0.72 is safe.\n\n7) Zone damper adjustments:\n- Goal: Slightly favor warmest zones (Z3, Z4), slightly trim the cooler ones (Z1, Z2) to maintain overall mass flow roughly similar while we modestly reduce fan.\n- Current: [0.85, 0.74, 0.96, 0.86]\n  - Z3 is already very open; Z4 also high.\n- Proposed small changes:\n  - Z1 (26.4°C, coolest and near target): reduce from 0.85 → 0.80 to shift some capacity to warmer zones and reduce its cooling slightly.\n  - Z2 (26.7°C): slight reduction from 0.74 → 0.72 to keep airflow but save a bit.\n  - Z3 (26.8°C, warm, near highest CO2): keep high or even slightly up to maintain strong cooling and ventilation: 0.96 → 0.97.\n  - Z4 (26.9°C, warm but good CO2): slight increase from 0.86 → 0.88.\n- These are small enough to avoid abrupt dynamic changes but bias air toward warmer zones.\n\n8) Check against bounds and objectives:\n- Bounds:\n  - Zone dampers: [0.05, 1.0] → 0.80, 0.72, 0.97, 0.88 all valid.\n  - OA damper: [0.05, 0.6] → 0.40 valid.\n  - Coil valve: [0.06, 1.0] → 0.83 valid.\n  - Fan speed: [0.45, 1.4] → 0.72 valid.\n- Expected effects next 5 minutes:\n  - Comfort: Slightly more cooling effectiveness in warm zones via coil + damper bias, even with a small fan reduction, should gently pull temps toward 26°C or at least prevent warming.\n  - CO2: OA slightly down but still moderate (0.40 vs 0.42) plus existing downward CO2 trends suggests CO2 should stay below or converge to target; still well below violation threshold.\n  - Energy: Lower fan and slightly lower OA should reduce fan and chiller/pump energy; coil is raised a bit, but net should be favorable given strong penalty on power and that fan power scales nonlinearly with speed.\n\n9) Final chosen action:\n- Zone dampers: [0.80, 0.72, 0.97, 0.88]\n- OA damper: 0.40\n- Coil valve: 0.83\n- Fan speed: 0.72"",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current conditions vs objectives:
- Temperature setpoint 26°C; comfort band 25–27°C.
- All zones are within band but slightly warm:
  • Z1: 26.4°C (rising +0.01°C/min) → projected ~26.45°C in 5 min.
  • Z2: 26.8°C (rising +0.02°C/min) → ~26.9°C, close to upper band.
  • Z3: 26.8°C (flat) → ~26.8°C.
  • Z4: 26.9°C (slightly cooling) → ~26.85°C.
- CO₂ situation:
  • Z1: 1012 ppm, increasing +1.7 ppm/min → ~1020 ppm in 5 min (above 1000 target, below 1100 violation).
  • Z2: 988 ppm, rising +3.5 ppm/min → ~1005 ppm (slightly above target).
  • Z3: 1000 ppm, decreasing −0.7 ppm/min → ~996 ppm (just below target).
  • Z4: 842 ppm, decreasing further.
- Outdoor air: 34.2°C, much hotter than indoors; additional OA hurts cooling energy but is needed for CO₂ control.
- Previous actions:
  • Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.72, 0.97, 0.88]
  • OA damper: 0.4 (relatively high with hot outdoor air)
  • Coil valve: 0.83 (strong cooling)
  • Fan speed: 0.72 (moderate-high airflow)

2) Trade-offs for reward:
- Comfort: We want to gently cool to keep all zones around 26°C and well inside 25–27°C without overshooting cold (which is penalized via Gaussian comfort shaping).
- CO₂: Penalty for being over 1000 ppm and a large extra penalty if any zone exceeds 1100 ppm. Z1 and Z2 are slightly above/approaching target; Z3 is right at target but trending down; Z4 is safe.
- Power: Weighted but not dominant vs comfort/CO₂. We can afford moderate energy to keep temps from drifting toward 27°C and to stop CO₂ from climbing.

3) Strategy per actuator:
- Coil valve: All zones slightly warm with upward or weak downward trends; outdoor is very hot. Keeping a fairly strong cooling coil opening is justified to avoid comfort penalties later. However, we can reduce slightly from 0.83 to trim energy while still maintaining or slightly improving temperatures, because fan and damper patterns also help. Move coil from 0.83 → 0.80.
- Fan speed: Higher fan increases both cooling delivery and ventilation (given OA fraction). But energy cost grows. Because multiple zones are warm and some CO₂ is above/near target, modestly increasing fan while not increasing OA fraction much can help CO₂ via more total mixed-air flow and also improve temperature with slightly lower coil. Bump fan from 0.72 → 0.75 (small increase, still well below max).
- Outdoor air damper: Outdoor is very hot, so we want to avoid excessive OA, but CO₂ in Z1 and Z2 is at/over target. Current OA is 0.4, which is relatively generous given 34.2°C. Since CO₂ is only slightly above target and below violation threshold and not climbing extremely fast, it’s more efficient to keep OA at 0.4 rather than increasing it further. Keeping it flat also prevents added cooling load. So hold OA damper at 0.40.
- Zone dampers (relative distribution):
  • Z2 and Z4 are warmest (26.8–26.9), but Z4 is already cooling slightly, while Z2 is warming more quickly and CO₂ is increasing fastest → Z2 deserves more flow.
  • Z1 is warmish with high CO₂ and rising; it also deserves good flow.
  • Z3 is warm but flat and CO₂ is slightly improving; we can slightly reduce its flow to help others and save some fan power while not hurting comfort much.
  • Z4 is warm but already trending down and CO₂ low; can modestly reduce damper without significant comfort risk, especially as coil and fan remain strong.
- We should make incremental, not drastic, changes to avoid overshoot and keep system stable.

4) Concrete damper adjustments (respecting 0.05–1.0 bounds):
- Start from previous:
  • Z1: 0.80 → slightly up to 0.82 to help with both temp and CO₂.
  • Z2: 0.72 → up more than Z1, say 0.80, to address both warming and CO₂.
  • Z3: 0.97 → down slightly to 0.92; still high but relinquishes some flow to Z1/Z2 and saves energy.
  • Z4: 0.88 → down moderately to 0.82; still strong but less than before since temp is already trending cooler and CO₂ is low.
- All stay within [0.05, 1.0]. These redistributions should improve comfort in the more critical Z1/Z2 while slightly lowering overall flow to zones that are less at risk.

5) Check against constraints and goals:
- All commands within action bounds.
- Temps likely to move slightly downward or stabilize closer to 26°C in all zones.
- CO₂: Additional supply/return mixing from higher fan plus maintained OA fraction and slightly favored flow to Z1/Z2 should slow or reverse CO₂ buildup without excessive OA.
- Power: Slight coil reduction counters the small fan increase; modest damper reductions in Z3/Z4 may also reduce total airflow demand somewhat. Overall, this should be an efficient compromise.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, violation threshold 1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy (fan/chiller/pumps) while maintaining comfort and air quality.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T = 26.5°C (within band, slightly warm vs 26°C), dT/dt ≈ +0.01°C/min → over 5 min ≈ +0.05°C → ~26.55°C. CO2 = 1017 ppm (>1000), rising at +0.9 ppm/min → +4.5 ppm over 5 min → ~1021 ppm.
- Zone 2: T = 26.8°C, dT/dt ≈ +0.01°C/min → ~26.85°C in 5 min (still inside comfort band but drifting warmer). CO2 = 995 ppm, rising at +1.2 ppm/min → +6 ppm → ~1001 ppm (just above target).
- Zone 3: T = 26.8°C, dT/dt ≈ 0 → ~26.8°C stable. CO2 = 997 ppm, trend -0.5 ppm/min → -2.5 ppm → ~994 ppm (slightly improving).
- Zone 4: T = 26.9°C, dT/dt ≈ -0.01°C/min → ~26.85°C (slightly cooling but still warm side). CO2 = 840 ppm, trending down.

Key issues:
- All zones are within 25–27°C, but all are above the 26°C comfort center and 3 zones are near the upper side of the band. So some cooling is still desirable but not aggressively.
- CO2: Zone 1 is already above 1000 ppm and rising; Zone 2 is about to move just above 1000 ppm; Zone 3 is just below and improving; Zone 4 is fine. We want to increase ventilation enough to pull Zone 1 and 2 back below 1000 ppm over the next intervals, but avoid excessive energy.
- Outdoor air is hot (34.2°C), so more OA increases ventilation but also raises cooling load. Trade-off: slightly increase OA and zone airflow plus modest cooling while keeping coil and fan from being too high.

2) Previous action:
- Zone dampers: [0.82, 0.80, 0.92, 0.82]
- OA damper: 0.40 (on a 0.05–0.60 range)
- Coil valve: 0.80 (strong cooling)
- Fan speed: 0.75
System currently providing fairly strong cooling with moderate OA and moderate fan.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
Thermal:
- Temperatures are drifting slightly warm. If we reduce cooling too much, some zones may approach or exceed 27°C in later intervals. But right now, short-term forecast remains within band.
- With OA air at 34.2°C, more OA increases temperatures and cooling load. So we should primarily control temperature with coil and fan, and use OA and zone dampers mainly to meet CO2 needs.

CO2:
- Zone 1 (1017 ppm, rising) needs more ventilation/flow.
- Zone 2 (995 ppm, rising) also needs a bit more.
- Zone 3 is near target but slightly improving; we can hold or slightly reduce its flow.
- Zone 4 is well below target; can reduce its damper to save energy and allow more capacity to other zones if there’s system-level constraint.
- OA damper is at 0.40; we can moderately increase it (towards 0.5–0.55) to boost fresh air without maxing at 0.6, which would strongly increase cooling load.

Energy:
- Coil valve at 0.8 is probably more than we need given all zones are within band and not rapidly heating. We can reduce coil a bit (e.g., ~0.7) to cut chiller load while still providing net cooling.
- Fan at 0.75 can be left roughly similar or slightly up if needed for CO2, but increasing fan speed raises power roughly cubically. Since distributions are already fairly open, small damper adjustments and OA increase may be enough; we can keep fan at 0.75 to avoid extra fan energy.

4) Concrete actuator decisions (bounded):
Bounds:
- Zone dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
- OA damper: [0.05, 0.6]
- Coil valve: [0.06, 1.0]
- Fan speed: [0.45, 1.4]

Zone dampers:
- Zone 1: Increase slightly above 0.82 to boost both cooling and ventilation where CO2 is worst. Choose 0.86.
- Zone 2: Increase modestly from 0.80 to 0.84.
- Zone 3: Slightly reduce from 0.92 to 0.88 since its CO2 is improving and temp is stable but warmish. This still keeps good flow.
- Zone 4: Reduce more, from 0.82 to 0.70, since both temperature and CO2 are comfortable and trending in safe directions; this saves airflow/energy and shifts relative capacity.
All are within [0.05, 1.0].

OA damper:
- Raise from 0.40 to 0.50. This significantly increases outdoor air fraction to help bring Zone 1/2 CO2 trending down or at least flatten, while not maxing out at 0.6. Given short 5-minute horizon, 0.5 is a reasonable compromise.

Coil valve:
- Reduce from 0.80 to 0.70. This decreases chiller energy while still providing enough cooling, even against 34.2°C outdoor air and slightly increased OA fraction. Given current temps and trends, this should keep zones within comfort band.

Fan speed:
- Keep at 0.75. Increased OA and targeted zone damper changes should help CO2 without needing more fan power. Keeping it constant avoids an energy increase.

5) Expected outcome next 5 min:
- Temperatures: Slight cooling effect from somewhat high coil (0.7) plus modestly increased flow in Zones 1–2 should prevent temperatures from drifting higher and might bring them slightly closer to 26°C, still well within 25–27°C.
- CO2: Higher OA (0.5) and higher Zone 1–2 flow likely reduce or reverse their upward CO2 trends, decreasing penalties and reducing risk of future violation threshold crossings.
- Energy: Coil valve reduced from 0.8 to 0.7 and small redistribution of zone dampers (plus unchanged fan) slightly lower energy use while maintaining comfort and air quality.

All values are clipped within the given bounds before finalizing.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.86, 0.84, 0.88, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.5, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and CO2 assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C, center 26°C.
- Zone temps: Z1=26.5°C, Z2=26.9°C, Z3=26.8°C, Z4=26.9°C.
  • All zones are inside the comfort band, but slightly warm vs 26°C, especially Z2–4.
  • Temp trends are flat to slightly rising (+0.01°C/min ≈ +0.05°C over 5 min for Z2 & Z4), so without more cooling, temps could drift closer to upper band edge but still likely within band.
- CO2: Z1=1000 ppm (at target), Z2=983 ppm, Z3=981 ppm, Z4=831 ppm, all trending down.
  • Peak CO2 is exactly at target and decreasing; violation threshold (1100 ppm) is not at risk over the next 5 min.

2) Energy/comfort trade-off:
- Current actions: zone_dampers≈[0.86,0.84,0.88,0.7], oa_damper=0.5, coil_valve=0.7, fan_speed=0.75.
- Outdoor air is hot (34.1°C), so high OA fraction increases cooling load.
- All zones are comfortably within the 25–27°C band and CO2 is safe and improving.
- To maximize reward: slightly reduce energy (fan + coil + OA) while maintaining temps within band and CO2 below 1000–1100 ppm.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Cooling need: Zones are on the warm side of the setpoint. Because outdoor air is much hotter than indoor, using more OA will not help cooling; it will increase coil and fan energy. Better to use mostly recirculated air and keep enough airflow for comfort.
- CO2: already decreasing at current ventilation rates. We can modestly reduce OA and possibly a bit of fan without risking CO2 violation over a 5-minute horizon.
- Zone-level balance: Z1 has highest CO2 (1000 ppm) but temp is slightly lower (26.5°C) than Z2–4. Zones 2–3 are warmest; Z4 is warm and has low CO2. Logical approach: keep airflow adequate everywhere but we don't need such high damper openings given that the system total flow (fan speed) is moderate.

4) Concrete adjustments:
- OA damper: currently 0.5 (quite high for 34°C outdoor air). CO2 is at or below target and trending down, so we can reduce toward mid–low range while staying above minimum 0.05 to preserve IAQ and avoid future CO2 rises.
  • Choose oa_damper ≈ 0.3. This should still provide decent ventilation but noticeably cut hot-air intake and coil load.
- Coil valve: currently 0.7. Zones are within band but slightly warm and outdoor is hot. Reducing coil too much could let zones drift toward 27°C or beyond; small downward adjustment is acceptable to save energy while leveraging existing cool air and recirculation.
  • Choose coil_valve ≈ 0.65 (small reduction). This maintains substantial cooling but trims power.
- Fan speed: currently 0.75. Lower fan speed reduces fan power significantly (typically cubic with speed) but reduces zone airflow and thus cooling delivery and CO2 removal. Since temps are a bit high and OA is being reduced, we should not reduce fan too aggressively.
  • Choose fan_speed ≈ 0.7 (modest reduction) to save power while maintaining comfort and ventilation effectiveness.
- Zone dampers:
  • Goal: keep similar relative distribution, slightly trim where possible because we are mainly reducing total flow via fan and OA, not redistributing drastically.
  • Z2–3–4 are the warmest; we don’t want to starve them. Z1 is slightly cooler and has highest CO2, but CO2 is trending down and near target.
  • Apply small uniform reductions to all zone dampers to align with reduced fan speed, keeping Z2–3 slightly higher relative to Z4.
  • From [0.86,0.84,0.88,0.7] → about a 5–7% trim: e.g. [0.82,0.80,0.84,0.66]. This still leaves all dampers high (good comfort), but shaves some flow and balancing remains similar.

5) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers must be in [0.05, 1.0]: proposed [0.82,0.80,0.84,0.66] are valid.
- OA damper in [0.05, 0.6]: proposed 0.3 is valid.
- Coil valve in [0.06, 1.0]: proposed 0.65 is valid.
- Fan speed in [0.45, 1.4]: proposed 0.7 is valid.

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Slightly less cooling and airflow, but still enough that zone temperatures should remain within the 25–27°C band, likely hovering near current levels given modest adjustments.
- CO2 should continue to decrease or stay near target, since it is already trending down and ventilation remains non-minimal.
- Power usage (fan, coil, and OA-induced load) should be reduced, improving the reward while avoiding comfort or CO2 penalties.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.82, 0.8, 0.84, 0.66], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.65, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Key objectives and current state:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band: 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize power (fan/chiller/pump) while meeting above.

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint, solidly within band), CO2 1026 ppm and rising at +4.9 ppm/min.
- Zone 2: 26.9°C (0.9°C above), CO2 1006 ppm, +4.5 ppm/min.
- Zone 3: 26.8°C (0.8°C above), CO2 998 ppm, +3.3 ppm/min (about to cross 1000 if trend continues).
- Zone 4: 26.9°C (0.9°C above), CO2 849 ppm, +3.5 ppm/min (CO2 safe but trending up).

Outdoor: 34°C, much hotter than indoors, so more OA will increase cooling load, but we need enough ventilation to bring CO2 back under 1000 ppm and avoid hitting 1100 ppm.

2) Trends over next 5 minutes (approximate):
If we did nothing different (keep similar airflow/ventilation):
- Zone 1 CO2: 1026 + 4.9*5 ≈ 1051 ppm (still below 1100 but further from target).
- Zone 2 CO2: 1006 + 4.5*5 ≈ 1029 ppm.
- Zone 3 CO2: 998 + 3.3*5 ≈ 1015 ppm.
- Zone 4 CO2: 849 + 3.5*5 ≈ 866 ppm.
So several zones would move further above 1000 ppm, increasing CO2 penalty and possibly approaching violation in future intervals. Temperatures are slightly above setpoint and roughly flat/slightly rising, so we need a bit more cooling and ventilation.

3) Strategy:
- Increase OA damper moderately to push CO2 back down while not overloading the chiller.
- Maintain or slightly increase fan speed to distribute more air/ventilation (helps both cooling and CO2) while being mindful of power.
- Maintain or slightly increase coil valve to provide enough cooling for the extra OA and to edge zone temps back toward 26°C but avoid overcooling below 25°C.
- Allocate more airflow to high-CO2 zones (1–3), maintain or slightly reduce Zone 4 damper since its CO2 is acceptable.

4) Actuator decisions (relative to previous action):
Previous:
- Zone dampers: [0.82, 0.8, 0.84, 0.66]
- OA damper: 0.3
- Coil valve: 0.65
- Fan speed: 0.7

4a) Outdoor air damper:
- CO2 in Zones 1–3 is already around or above 1000 ppm and trending up. To meaningfully reduce CO2, we should increase OA fraction, but not too aggressively because outdoor air is 34°C.
- A moderate step from 0.30 to 0.40 increases ventilation by ~33% while keeping within the 0.05–0.6 range and not at the maximum.
Chosen OA damper: 0.40 (within [0.05, 0.6]).

4b) Fan speed:
- Higher fan speed increases total airflow (cooling capacity delivery and dilution of CO2), but increases fan power (weighted by power_weight 0.2).
- Given all zones are slightly warm and CO2 is edging above target, a small bump is justified.
- Move from 0.70 to 0.78: a modest increase for better circulation and ventilation without approaching very high energy.
Chosen fan speed: 0.78 (within [0.45, 1.4]).

4c) Coil valve (cooling capacity):
- Zones are 0.5–0.9°C above setpoint, and OA temperature is much higher than indoor temp, so the additional OA will increase sensible load.
- To prevent temps from drifting further above 27°C, increase cooling slightly from 0.65 to 0.72.
- This should drive temps modestly down toward 26°C while offsetting the warmer OA generated load.
Chosen coil valve: 0.72 (within [0.06, 1.0]).

4d) Zone dampers (relative distribution):
We want to prioritize ventilation and cooling for high CO2 and slightly warm zones while not starving Zone 4.
- Zone 1: Highest CO2 (1026 ppm and fastest rise). Keep relatively high damper or even slightly increase vs others.
  * From 0.82 to 0.85 to bias a bit more air here.
- Zone 2: CO2 1006 ppm, also above target and warm.
  * From 0.80 to 0.83.
- Zone 3: CO2 998 ppm, just below target but rising, temp slightly high.
  * From 0.84 to 0.86 (still one of the highest flows; helps keep CO2 from crossing too much above 1000 and helps cooling).
- Zone 4: CO2 is much lower (849 ppm) though temp is also slightly high; we can keep it similar or slightly lower than others, relying on increased fan+coil for some extra cooling without over-ventilating.
  * From 0.66 to 0.64, freeing a bit of system capacity for zones 1–3 while still maintaining good airflow.

All zone damper values are within [0.05, 1.0]. The overall strategy increases total airflow and OA moderately, focuses airflow on the highest CO2 zones, and boosts cooling enough to keep temperatures within the comfort band while avoiding overuse of energy.

5) Clipping and final check:
- Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.83, 0.86, 0.64] all between 0.05 and 1.0.
- OA damper: 0.40 between 0.05 and 0.6.
- Coil valve: 0.72 between 0.06 and 1.0.
- Fan speed: 0.78 between 0.45 and 1.4.
These settings should improve CO2 toward or below 1000 ppm, keep temperatures within 25–27°C and trending toward 26°C, and use only a moderate increase in power, which is acceptable given comfort and CO2 penalties in the reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.83, 0.86, 0.64], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.72, ""fan_speed"": 0.78}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Comfort: All zones are within the comfort band 25–27°C but slightly warm relative to the 26°C center.
  • Z1: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint), flat trend.
  • Z2: 26.9°C (0.9°C above), flat trend.
  • Z3: 26.8°C (0.8°C above), flat trend.
  • Z4: 27.0°C (1.0°C above), slightly rising (0.01°C/min ≈ +0.05°C over next 5 min).
- CO2:
  • Z1: 1021 ppm, decreasing slightly (−0.9 ppm/min ≈ −4.5 ppm over 5 min) → ~1016 ppm, still >1000.
  • Z2: 1004 ppm, decreasing slowly (−0.4 ppm/min) → ~1002 ppm, slightly above target.
  • Z3: 993 ppm, decreasing (−0.8 ppm/min) → ~989 ppm, slightly below target.
  • Z4: 852 ppm, rising (+0.5 ppm/min) → ~877 ppm, still well below 1000.
- Outdoor air: 34.5°C and rising, so additional OA significantly increases cooling load.
- Previous actuators:
  • Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.83, 0.86, 0.64]
  • OA damper: 0.40
  • Coil valve: 0.72
  • Fan speed: 0.78

We need to balance: keep CO2 under 1000 ppm to avoid penalties, maintain comfort near 26°C while minimizing energy (coil + fan + OA).

2) Strategic considerations for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are on the warm side and not decreasing, meaning current cooling effort is just holding (or slightly under-performing) against load.
- CO2 in Z1 and Z2 are slightly above target but decreasing already at OA=0.40 and fan=0.78.
- OA air is very hot; more OA strongly increases cooling demand and energy use.

Given the short 5-minute horizon:
- If we reduce cooling or airflow too much, temperatures will rise and drift further above 27°C (especially Z4 already at 27.0°C and rising slightly), causing larger comfort penalties.
- If we reduce OA damper too much, CO2 in Z1 and Z2 could stop decreasing or begin rising, risking higher CO2 penalties.
- However, we can likely trim energy slightly while still staying within comfort band and near CO2 target by modestly reducing fan speed and coil valve, and slightly rebalancing dampers.

3) Zone-by-zone thinking:
- Z1 (26.5°C, 1021 ppm, CO2 ↓): Slightly too warm and slightly above CO2 target but safely below violation threshold and trending down. We want a bit more cooling, but CO2 is acceptable. Its damper is high (0.85); we can maintain high flow for cooling without increasing OA proportion directly, since OA is set globally.
- Z2 (26.9°C, 1004 ppm, CO2 ↓): Warmest except Z4 and slightly above CO2 target; needs cooling and modest ventilation; damper at 0.83, so similar to Z1.
- Z3 (26.8°C, 993 ppm, CO2 ↓): Temperature similar to Z2 but CO2 already below target; its damper is the highest (0.86). We can reduce Z3 a bit to shift relative capacity/airflow to others and reduce fan power need.
- Z4 (27.0°C, 852 ppm, CO2 ↑): Warmest and slightly rising, but CO2 is comfortably low. Needs more cooling air but not more OA specifically. A modest damper increase can help comfort without additional global OA.

4) OA damper decision:
- Current OA=0.40, and CO2 in the worst zones is only barely above target and trending down. With hot outdoor air, increasing OA above 0.40 would raise coil load and likely energy substantially.
- Slightly decreasing OA might risk flattening CO2 decline. Given that Z1 and Z2 are above target, it is safer to keep OA at 0.40 to ensure CO2 continues to trend downward, avoiding extra CO2 penalties and any approach to violation threshold.
- Decision: keep OA damper at 0.40.

5) Coil valve and fan speed:
- Current coil=0.72, fan=0.78. Temperatures are warm but stable at these settings.
- Any large reduction in coil or fan risks temperatures moving above 27°C in some zones within 5 minutes, especially Z4, which is already at 27.0°C and slightly rising.
- However, the band is 25–27°C, and the center is 26°C with a sigma of 0.25, so slight overshoot above the center but within band likely still yields good comfort reward. A small reduction in energy may not noticeably degrade comfort over just 5 minutes.
- Strategy: very modest reductions to save energy while staying within comfort band and minimizing upward drift.
  • Coil valve: reduced slightly from 0.72 to 0.70. This still provides strong cooling but reduces chiller load a bit.
  • Fan speed: reduced slightly from 0.78 to 0.76. This reduces fan power and might slightly reduce delivered cooling and ventilation but likely not enough in 5 minutes to push temps or CO2 out of acceptable range.

6) Zone damper adjustments:
We want to prioritize cooling for the warmest zones (Z2, Z3, Z4) while recognizing their CO2 states.
- Z1: 26.5°C, 1021 ppm (above target but trending down). Keep airflow reasonably high to sustain cooling and CO2 reduction. We can maintain roughly as is or trim very slightly to favor hotter zones. Since Z1 is not worst for comfort, a tiny reduction is acceptable.
- Z2: 26.9°C, 1004 ppm (slightly above target, warm). Needs a bit more cooling. We can increase its damper slightly to improve comfort.
- Z3: 26.8°C, 993 ppm (below CO2 target). Its damper is highest; we can reduce it slightly to free some flow/relative capacity, reduce fan work marginally, and reallocate to Z2 and Z4.
- Z4: 27.0°C, 852 ppm (low CO2, hottest and rising). Increase damper somewhat more aggressively to bring it down toward the center.

Specific, gentle rebalancing:
- Z1 damper: from 0.85 → 0.84 (minor decrease).
- Z2 damper: from 0.83 → 0.86 (slight increase to favor this warm, slightly high-CO2 zone).
- Z3 damper: from 0.86 → 0.82 (reduce from highest to free capacity/energy; CO2 is already good).
- Z4 damper: from 0.64 → 0.70 (moderate bump to reduce its temperature while CO2 is low).

All damper values remain well within [0.05, 1.0]. Combined with a slight fan and coil reduction, this should:
- Keep or slightly improve comfort in Z2 and Z4.
- Maintain comfort in Z1 and Z3 within the band.
- Maintain or slightly improve CO2 trends due to preserved OA fraction and reasonably high fan speed.
- Reduce total power a bit (lower fan speed and coil valve) without a significant comfort or CO2 penalty.

7) Bounds check and final clipping:
- zone_dampers: [0.84, 0.86, 0.82, 0.70] ∈ [0.05, 1.0] → no clipping needed.
- oa_damper: 0.40 ∈ [0.05, 0.60] → no clipping needed.
- coil_valve: 0.70 ∈ [0.06, 1.0] → no clipping needed.

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:\n- Comfort: All zones are within the comfort band 25–27°C but slightly warm relative to the 26°C center.\n  • Z1: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint), flat trend.\n  • Z2: 26.9°C (0.9°C above), flat trend.\n  • Z3: 26.8°C (0.8°C above), flat trend.\n  • Z4: 27.0°C (1.0°C above), slightly rising (0.01°C/min ≈ +0.05°C over next 5 min).\n- CO2:\n  • Z1: 1021 ppm, decreasing slightly (−0.9 ppm/min ≈ −4.5 ppm over 5 min) → ~1016 ppm, still >1000.\n  • Z2: 1004 ppm, decreasing slowly (−0.4 ppm/min) → ~1002 ppm, slightly above target.\n  • Z3: 993 ppm, decreasing (−0.8 ppm/min) → ~989 ppm, slightly below target.\n  • Z4: 852 ppm, rising (+0.5 ppm/min) → ~877 ppm, still well below 1000.\n- Outdoor air: 34.5°C and rising, so additional OA significantly increases cooling load.\n- Previous actuators:\n  • Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.83, 0.86, 0.64]\n  • OA damper: 0.40\n  • Coil valve: 0.72\n  • Fan speed: 0.78\n\nWe need to balance: keep CO2 under 1000 ppm to avoid penalties, maintain comfort near 26°C while minimizing energy (coil + fan + OA).\n\n2) Strategic considerations for next 5 minutes:\n- Temperatures are on the warm side and not decreasing, meaning current cooling effort is just holding (or slightly under-performing) against load.\n- CO2 in Z1 and Z2 are slightly above target but decreasing already at OA=0.40 and fan=0.78.\n- OA air is very hot; more OA strongly increases cooling demand and energy use.\n\nGiven the short 5-minute horizon:\n- If we reduce cooling or airflow too much, temperatures will rise and drift further above 27°C (especially Z4 already at 27.0°C and rising slightly), causing larger comfort penalties.\n- If we reduce OA damper too much, CO2 in Z1 and Z2 could stop decreasing or begin rising, risking higher CO2 penalties.\n- However, we can likely trim energy slightly while still staying within comfort band and near CO2 target by modestly reducing fan speed and coil valve, and slightly rebalancing dampers.\n\n3) Zone-by-zone thinking:\n- Z1 (26.5°C, 1021 ppm, CO2 ↓): Slightly too warm and slightly above CO2 target but safely below violation threshold and trending down. We want a bit more cooling, but CO2 is acceptable. Its damper is high (0.85); we can maintain high flow for cooling without increasing OA proportion directly, since OA is set globally.\n- Z2 (26.9°C, 1004 ppm, CO2 ↓): Warmest except Z4 and slightly above CO2 target; needs cooling and modest ventilation; damper at 0.83, so similar to Z1.\n- Z3 (26.8°C, 993 ppm, CO2 ↓): Temperature similar to Z2 but CO2 already below target; its damper is the highest (0.86). We can reduce Z3 a bit to shift relative capacity/airflow to others and reduce fan power need.\n- Z4 (27.0°C, 852 ppm, CO2 ↑): Warmest and slightly rising, but CO2 is comfortably low. Needs more cooling air but not more OA specifically. A modest damper increase can help comfort without additional global OA.\n\n4) OA damper decision:\n- Current OA=0.40, and CO2 in the worst zones is only barely above target and trending down. With hot outdoor air, increasing OA above 0.40 would raise coil load and likely energy substantially.\n- Slightly decreasing OA might risk flattening CO2 decline. Given that Z1 and Z2 are above target, it is safer to keep OA at 0.40 to ensure CO2 continues to trend downward, avoiding extra CO2 penalties and any approach to violation threshold.\n- Decision: keep OA damper at 0.40.\n\n5) Coil valve and fan speed:\n- Current coil=0.72, fan=0.78. Temperatures are warm but stable at these settings.\n- Any large reduction in coil or fan risks temperatures moving above 27°C in some zones within 5 minutes, especially Z4, which is already at 27.0°C and slightly rising.\n- However, the band is 25–27°C, and the center is 26°C with a sigma of 0.25, so slight overshoot above the center but within band likely still yields good comfort reward. A small reduction in energy may not noticeably degrade comfort over just 5 minutes.\n- Strategy: very modest reductions to save energy while staying within comfort band and minimizing upward drift.\n  • Coil valve: reduced slightly from 0.72 to 0.70. This still provides strong cooling but reduces chiller load a bit.\n  • Fan speed: reduced slightly from 0.78 to 0.76. This reduces fan power and might slightly reduce delivered cooling and ventilation but likely not enough in 5 minutes to push temps or CO2 out of acceptable range.\n\n6) Zone damper adjustments:\nWe want to prioritize cooling for the warmest zones (Z2, Z3, Z4) while recognizing their CO2 states.\n- Z1: 26.5°C, 1021 ppm (above target but trending down). Keep airflow reasonably high to sustain cooling and CO2 reduction. We can maintain roughly as is or trim very slightly to favor hotter zones. Since Z1 is not worst for comfort, a tiny reduction is acceptable.\n- Z2: 26.9°C, 1004 ppm (slightly above target, warm). Needs a bit more cooling. We can increase its damper slightly to improve comfort.\n- Z3: 26.8°C, 993 ppm (below CO2 target). Its damper is highest; we can reduce it slightly to free some flow/relative capacity, reduce fan work marginally, and reallocate to Z2 and Z4.\n- Z4: 27.0°C, 852 ppm (low CO2, hottest and rising). Increase damper somewhat more aggressively to bring it down toward the center.\n\nSpecific, gentle rebalancing:\n- Z1 damper: from 0.85 → 0.84 (minor decrease).\n- Z2 damper: from 0.83 → 0.86 (slight increase to favor this warm, slightly high-CO2 zone).\n- Z3 damper: from 0.86 → 0.82 (reduce from highest to free capacity/energy; CO2 is already good).\n- Z4 damper: from 0.64 → 0.70 (moderate bump to reduce its temperature while CO2 is low).\n\nAll damper values remain well within [0.05, 1.0]. Combined with a slight fan and coil reduction, this should:\n- Keep or slightly improve comfort in Z2 and Z4.\n- Maintain comfort in Z1 and Z3 within the band.\n- Maintain or slightly improve CO2 trends due to preserved OA fraction and reasonably high fan speed.\n- Reduce total power a bit (lower fan speed and coil valve) without a significant comfort or CO2 penalty.\n\n7) Bounds check and final clipping:\n- zone_dampers: [0.84, 0.86, 0.82, 0.70] ∈ [0.05, 1.0] → no clipping needed.\n- oa_damper: 0.40 ∈ [0.05, 0.60] → no clipping needed.\n- coil_valve: 0.70 ∈ [0.06, 1.0] → no clipping needed.\n- fan_speed: 0.76 ∈ [0.45, 1.4] → no clipping needed.\n\nThese setpoints aim to maximize the reward over the next 5 minutes by keeping all zones within or very near the comfort band, gently steering CO2 toward or below 1000 ppm without approaching 1100 ppm, and modestly reducing energy use."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize fan/chiller power.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.5°C (inside comfort band, slightly warm vs 26°C), dT/dt≈+0.01°C/min → over 5 min ≈+0.05°C → ~26.55°C. CO2=1021 ppm (>1000), trending -0.1 ppm/min → over 5 min ≈ -0.5 ppm → ~1020.5 ppm (still above 1000 but comfortably below 1100).
- Zone 2: T=26.9°C, dT/dt≈+0.01°C/min → 26.95°C (near top of band). CO2=1003 ppm, trending down to ≈1002.5 ppm.
- Zone 3: T=26.8°C → 26.85°C. CO2=992 ppm → 991.5 ppm.
- Zone 4: T=27.0°C, dT/dt≈+0.01°C/min → 27.05°C (slightly outside upper comfort band). CO2=853 ppm rising slowly to ≈853.5 ppm.

Outdoor: 35.1°C and rising fast (+6.6°C/h) → outside air is much hotter than zones; more OA increases cooling load significantly.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.84, 0.86, 0.82, 0.70]
- OA damper: 0.40
- Coil valve: 0.70
- Fan speed: 0.76

All zones are slightly warm with small upward trends despite reasonably high coil (0.70) and moderate-high fan (0.76). That suggests outdoor and/or internal loads are high. However, trends are very small (+0.05°C/5 min), meaning we're close to balance; we just need a bit more cooling to pull temps back toward 26°C, especially Zone 4.

CO2:
- The only zones over 1000 ppm are 1 and 2, both just slightly above and already trending down, so current OA and airflow appear sufficient for trajectory toward target without risk of 1100 ppm violation soon.

2) Trade-offs:
- Cooling/comfort vs power: Slight temp overshoot is mild. Increasing fan and coil greatly to hit 26°C precisely would increase power noticeably; small adjustments are better.
- Ventilation vs power: OA is 0.40 (on a 0.05–0.60 range) while outside is 35.1°C. Higher OA raises chiller load. Given CO2 >1000 only slightly and trending down, we can modestly reduce OA to cut load but must not reverse CO2 trend upwards too much.
- Zone-level balancing: Zone 4 is warmest (will leave comfort band). We can increase its damper relative to others to deliver more cool air while slightly easing others to reduce overall flow and energy.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Slightly increase total cooling capacity to nudge temps down or at least stop upward drift, focusing on Zone 4.
- Slightly reduce OA damper to lower load while keeping adequate ventilation for CO2.
- Keep fan close to current; small upward change can help distribute more cooling air, but too much hurts power.
- Use zone damper re-balancing rather than big global increases.

4) Concrete adjustments:
Fan speed:
- Currently 0.76 (bounds 0.45–1.40). Zones are just slightly above band; a modest increase improves cooling distribution with limited power penalty. Move to 0.80 for a light boost without jumping much in fan power.

Coil valve:
- Currently 0.70 (0.06–1.0). Given the outdoor heat and slight upward temperature drift, slightly increase to 0.75 to boost cooling capacity just enough to start nudging temps down, especially for Zone 4, while avoiding high chiller energy of large jumps.

OA damper:
- Currently 0.40 (0.05–0.60). With high outdoor temperature, we want to reduce load but not compromise CO2. Given Zones 1 & 2 are only ~20 ppm above target and decreasing, we can slightly reduce OA from 0.40 to 0.35, improving energy efficiency. This may slow the CO2 decrease but should still keep all zones below 1100 ppm and likely near the 1000 target over time.

Zone dampers (0.05–1.0):
Goal: More cooling to Zone 4, slight reductions in others to keep overall airflow and energy moderated.
- Zone 4: warmest and slightly leaving comfort band. Increase damper from 0.70 to 0.80 to direct more cool air.
- Zone 1: 26.5°C and CO2 ~1020 ppm trending down; we don't need more air than before. Slightly reduce damper from 0.84 to 0.80 to free capacity for Zone 4 and decrease energy slightly.
- Zone 2: warm (26.9) and slightly high CO2 (1003) but trending down. Keep airflow similar; small reduction from 0.86 to 0.84 to modestly balance and not cut ventilation too aggressively.
- Zone 3: 26.8°C, CO2 below target already. Slightly reduce damper from 0.82 to 0.78.

These changes modestly reallocate flow toward Zone 4 and slightly reduce total zone damper opening while increasing fan and coil a bit—balancing comfort improvement against energy.

5) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers: [0.80, 0.84, 0.78, 0.80] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.35 within [0.05, 0.60].
- Coil valve: 0.75 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.80 within [0.45, 1.40].

6) Expected effects next 5 minutes:
- Slightly increased fan and coil plus rebalanced dampers should stop or reverse the small upward temperature trends, especially reducing Zone 4 toward or into the comfort band while keeping other zones near 26.5–26.8°C.
- OA reduction from 0.40 to 0.35 should incrementally reduce chiller load but still keep CO2 trending near target, with minimal risk of violation.
- Overall, this should improve comfort reward slightly while moderating power consumption, consistent with maximizing the provided reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.84, 0.78, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.75, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C with comfort band 25–27°C.
- Temps: Z1=26.6, Z2=27.0, Z3=26.9, Z4=27.0. All within band but warm-biased and slightly above 26°C.
- Temp trends are flat to slightly rising (0.00–0.01°C/min) except Z4 slightly cooling (-0.01°C/min). In 5 minutes, without stronger cooling, Z2–3 may exceed 27°C; Z1 already 26.6.
- CO2: Z1=1028, Z2=1009, Z3=998, Z4=855 ppm. Z1 and Z2 are already above 1000 ppm target and slowly increasing; Z3 is right below 1000 and rising; Z4 is OK. Violation threshold is 1100 ppm with big penalty, so we must prevent further buildup.
- Outdoor temp: 35.1°C, much hotter than indoor, so more OA to dilute CO2 will add heat and load to coil/chiller and fan.
- Current actuators: zone dampers moderately high (0.78–0.84), OA damper 0.35 (already substantial with 35°C OA), coil valve 0.75 (strong cooling), fan speed 0.8.
- Reward trade-offs: We must keep CO2 under 1100 ppm and close to 1000 with minimal power, while keeping temps near 26°C. Given present CO2 near/above 1000 and increasing, CO2 and comfort constraints dominate over energy minimization for this 5-min horizon.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Cooling: Indoor temps are near or slightly above setpoint and trending up. Slightly increase cooling capacity or at least not reduce it, so that zones drift toward 26°C instead of rising above 27°C.
- Ventilation/CO2: Z1 and Z2 are already above 1000 ppm and rising; Z3 approaching target. To avoid hitting 1100 ppm later, we should modestly increase OA fraction while also increasing total air flow (fan and zone flows). However, OA is very hot, so OA increase should be moderate and rely more on total CFM rather than an aggressive OA fraction.
- Energy: Since temps are warm and OA is hot, we cannot reduce coil or fan significantly without comfort and CO2 penalties. Focus on modest, targeted increases where most beneficial.

3) Actuator-by-actuator reasoning (relative to previous action):
- Fan speed (prev 0.8, bounds 0.45–1.4):
  • Higher fan speed boosts cooling delivery and CO2 dilution to all zones.
  • Current CO2 trends are positive; to bend them downward, we likely need more total flow, especially to Z1–3.
  • Increase modestly to avoid large power jumps: choose ~0.9. This increases CFM ~12.5% over 0.8, helping both comfort and CO2.

- Coil valve (prev 0.75, bounds 0.06–1.0):
  • With higher fan and 35°C OA, the mixed air temperature will be higher if OA is increased, so we need enough coil capacity to maintain supply temp.
  • Zones are slightly warm; stronger cooling is okay, but overshooting below 25°C wastes energy and harms comfort.
  • Slight increase to ~0.8 gives extra cooling margin to offset additional OA heat without a big energy penalty.

- Outdoor air (OA) damper (prev 0.35, bounds 0.05–0.6):
  • CO2 in Z1 and Z2 is >1000 ppm and rising slowly; Z3 close to 1000. Without increased OA, these likely continue upward, risking approach to violation range over subsequent intervals.
  • However, outdoor is 35°C, so OA increases are expensive. We use a moderate increment: from 0.35 to ~0.4 to gently enhance ventilation and CO2 control.
  • Combined with higher fan speed, effective outdoor CFM rises more than 5 percentage points, but coil cooling increase should compensate.

- Zone dampers (prev: Z1=0.8, Z2=0.84, Z3=0.78, Z4=0.8; bounds 0.05–1.0):
  • Goal: prioritize air to zones with high CO2 and slightly warm temps without overly starving others.
  • Z1: Temp 26.6 and highest CO2 (1028, rising). Slight increase in flow will help both cooling and CO2. Move to about 0.85.
  • Z2: 27.0°C and CO2 1009; needs both cooling and dilution. Make it our highest flow. Increase to about 0.9.
  • Z3: 26.9°C and CO2 998 (near target, rising). Needs some extra cooling and ventilation, but slightly less critical than Z1–2. Increase a bit to ~0.82.
  • Z4: 27.0°C but CO2 relatively low (855, mild rise) and temp trend slightly downward. We can hold or slightly reduce flow to allocate more relative capacity to other zones and save some energy. Decrease to ~0.76.
  • These small adjustments bias available capacity toward the zones with worst CO2 and highest temps while keeping all zones ventilated and cooled.

4) Check objectives and bounds:
- All chosen values within specified bounds.
- Comfort: Slightly more cooling and targeted air distribution should pull zone temps toward 26°C and avoid crossing 27°C.
- CO2: Higher OA and fan plus biased flow to Z1–3 should reduce or at least flatten CO2 trajectories, helping keep all zones below 1100 ppm and closer to the 1000 ppm target.
- Energy: Increases in fan and coil are modest (0.8→0.9, 0.75→0.8, OA 0.35→0.4). This trades a moderate power rise for better comfort and CO2 penalties, which should improve overall reward under the given weights.

5) Final clipped setpoints (already within bounds, so clipping not needed beyond ensuring float representation):

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Comfort: Target 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
  • Zone 1: 26.5°C (within band, slightly warm vs center).
  • Zone 2: 27.0°C (at upper band limit).
  • Zone 3: 26.9°C (near upper band).
  • Zone 4: 27.0°C (at upper band limit).
  Temperatures are flat or very slightly decreasing (temp_delta ≈ 0), indicating current cooling is roughly balancing internal gains. Slightly high temps suggest we still need strong cooling; we don’t want to reduce cooling yet.

- CO2: Target <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
  • Zone 1: 1011 ppm, trending down (-2.9 ppm/min) → projected in 5 min ≈ 996 ppm (back under target) if conditions similar.
  • Zone 2: 995 ppm, trending down → stays around/below 1000.
  • Zone 3: 987 ppm, trending down.
  • Zone 4: 848 ppm, trending down.
  CO2 is close to threshold in Zone 1 and 2 but improving. We should avoid reducing outdoor air too aggressively to keep CO2 comfortably below 1000 ppm.

- Outdoor: 35.1°C, much hotter than indoors, so more outdoor air increases cooling load. There’s a trade-off between ventilation (CO2) and energy.

- Previous action:
  • zone_dampers: [0.85, 0.9, 0.82, 0.76]
  • oa_damper: 0.4 (within 0.05–0.6)
  • coil_valve: 0.8 (strong cooling, within 0.06–1.0)
  • fan_speed: 0.9 (within 0.45–1.4)
  System is already in a fairly aggressive cooling / ventilation mode.

2) Reward trade-offs:
- Comfort: We’re slightly too warm in Zones 2–4 (at/near 27°C). More cooling or more airflow will help pull them toward 26°C.
- CO2: Zone 1 is just above target but trending down with current OA and flows. Dropping OA significantly could slow/stop that improvement and increase CO2 penalty. Raising OA a lot would increase chiller/fan energy due to hot outside air.
- Energy: Coil at 0.8 and fan at 0.9 are high but justifiable because indoor temps are at the warm limit and outside is very hot; reducing them now risks drifting above 27°C, increasing comfort penalties.

3) Control strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Coil valve: Keep high to add a bit more cooling margin; indoor temps are at or near upper comfort band with flat trends. We can’t see supply temp, but with 35°C outside, it’s risky to reduce coil. Increasing from 0.8 to 0.85 brings slightly more cooling without maxing out at 1.0. That should start nudging all zones toward 26°C.

- Fan speed: Higher fan speed improves heat transfer and distribution and increases total airflow (and thus effective sensible cooling) but increases fan power. Currently 0.9; temps are high and flat, so a modest increase is justified to gently pull them down while not going to extremes. Move to 0.95.

- Outdoor air (oa_damper): With Zone 1 at 1011 ppm and falling fairly quickly, current OA of 0.4 appears adequate for CO2 control. Reducing OA to save energy might slow the CO2 drop and risk hovering around or above 1000 ppm, incurring penalty. Increasing OA toward 0.6 would raise ventilation energy significantly with marginal CO2 benefit. Best trade-off: keep OA at 0.4.

- Zone dampers: All zones are warm, but Zones 2–4 are at or very near the upper limit, while Zone 1 is slightly cooler (26.5°C) but has the highest CO2. Actions:
  • Zone 1: Slightly too warm and slightly high CO2. Avoid reducing airflow; a small increase can help both cooling and dilution. From 0.85 → 0.88.
  • Zone 2: Warmest and high CO2 (995 ppm). Increase flow slightly more aggressively to improve comfort. From 0.9 → 0.94.
  • Zone 3: Similar to Zone 2 but slightly lower CO2. Moderate increase. From 0.82 → 0.86.
  • Zone 4: Warm but CO2 is relatively low; we can still support comfort but don’t need as much extra ventilation as Zones 1–3. Small increase. From 0.76 → 0.79.
  These are incremental changes, avoiding large jumps that would spike fan energy and potentially overshoot.

4) Bounds check:
- zone_dampers must be in [0.05, 1.0]: all proposed values 0.88, 0.94, 0.86, 0.79 are within.
- oa_damper in [0.05, 0.6]: 0.4 is within.
- coil_valve in [0.06, 1.0]: 0.85 is within.
- fan_speed in [0.45, 1.4]: 0.95 is within.

5) Expected effect for next interval:
- Slightly higher coil and fan plus modest damper increases should begin to bring all zones down from 26.5–27.0°C toward ~26.5°C or lower over the next few intervals, staying within comfort band and improving center-of-band proximity.
- CO2 will continue trending downward in all zones, with Zone 1 moving clearly below 1000 ppm, limiting CO2 penalties.
- Energy use rises somewhat vs. previous, but the primary concern is avoiding comfort and CO2 penalties at this warm, high-load time of day; small, targeted increases are a reasonable trade-off.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.94, 0.86, 0.79], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.85, ""fan_speed"": 0.95}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state and objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- All zone temps: 26.5, 26.9, 26.8, 26.9°C → all within band but slightly above center; trends are -0.01°C/min, so ~ -0.05°C over next 5 min (slight cooling already happening).
- CO2 levels: 994, 979, 973, 838 ppm with small negative trends → all under 1000 ppm, decreasing; far from 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Outdoor air is hot: 35°C, so extra OA increases both sensible load and coil energy.

Given this, we should:
- Maintain or slightly reduce cooling capacity to gently pull temps toward 26°C without overshooting or wasting energy.
- Maintain adequate ventilation but avoid excess OA since CO2 is already near target and decreasing.
- Consider modest fan reduction to save power while ensuring airflow and zone mixing remain enough to keep trends favorable.

2) Assess previous action:
- zone_dampers: [0.88, 0.94, 0.86, 0.79] → relatively high flows overall.
- oa_damper: 0.4 (allowed 0.05–0.6) → moderate OA while outdoor is very hot.
- coil_valve: 0.85 (allowed 0.06–1.0) → strong cooling.
- fan_speed: 0.95 (allowed 0.45–1.4) → high fan power.

Given current conditions (temps slightly above center but already drifting down, CO2 just under target and falling), we can safely reduce energy while staying inside comfort and CO2 constraints.

3) Zone-wise reasoning:
- All zone temps are similar with very small negative trends; none is close to 27°C or rising.
- Zone 1 CO2 is highest at 994 ppm but dropping ~3.2 ppm/min. Over 5 min, that’s ~16 ppm drop → around 978 ppm even if we slightly reduce OA and fan, as long as we don’t make drastic cuts.

Thus, we can:
- Keep zone damper pattern similar (slight balancing) but reduce them a bit to reflect lower required airflow, saving fan energy and reheat/chiller energy.
- Maintain slightly higher damper for Zone 1 and Zone 2 due to higher CO2 and slightly higher temps.

4) OA damper decision:
- CO2 already below 1000 ppm and trending down.
- Outdoor is 35°C, so extra OA is costly.
- Reward penalizes power and CO2 but CO2 penalty weight is moderate (0.5) and we’re below the target; there’s no violation risk.
- Reasonable to trim OA from 0.4 to around 0.3 to reduce conditioning load while still providing decent ventilation.

5) Coil valve decision:
- Temps are within band but above center and slowly declining.
- With outdoor at 35°C, some strong cooling is still needed; however, 0.85 may be more than necessary given downward trends.
- Reducing coil to ~0.80 should still maintain or slightly increase cooling capacity per zone given we’ll also reduce airflow somewhat; the net effect should keep temps drifting gently downward toward ~26.3–26.6°C, comfortably within band.

6) Fan speed decision:
- Fan at 0.95 is high; fan power is typically cubic with speed, so small reductions save a lot.
- Because zone dampers are high and temps/CO2 trends are favorable, we can reduce speed moderately to ~0.90 without risking comfort or ventilation over a 5-min horizon.

7) Zone damper adjustments:
- Reduce each slightly to cut total airflow while preserving pattern:
  - Zone 1: from 0.88 → 0.85 (still relatively high for highest CO2 and temp).
  - Zone 2: from 0.94 → 0.90 (it’s the warmest; keep high flow but trim a bit for energy).
  - Zone 3: from 0.86 → 0.82.
  - Zone 4: from 0.79 → 0.75 (lowest CO2 and similar temp; safe to reduce more).
- All within bounds [0.05, 1.0].

8) Check against bounds and clip:
- zone_dampers: [0.85, 0.90, 0.82, 0.75] → all within [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.30 → within [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve: 0.80 → within [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.90 → within [0.45, 1.4].

9) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Slightly reduced airflow, coil, and OA will lower power_kw meaningfully.
- Zone temps should remain within 25–27°C (likely still slightly above 26°C but drifting down), so comfort_reward high and penalties small.
- CO2 should remain <1000 ppm and continue trending down, avoiding both CO2 penalty and violation penalty.
- Overall this should improve the reward vs. maintaining previous, more aggressive settings.

Therefore, we implement a modest energy-saving step while preserving comfort and air quality.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.9, 0.82, 0.75], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.9}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Key observations:
- All zone temperatures are within the comfort band (25–27°C) and slightly above the 26°C center: 26.5, 26.9, 26.8, 26.9°C.
- Temperature trends are slightly downward (-0.01°C/min), so in 5 minutes each zone will cool by ~0.05°C, moving closer to 26°C without extra cooling.
- CO2:
  • Zone 1: 1004 ppm, rising +2 ppm/min → ~1014 ppm in 5 min (above 1000 target but below 1100 violation).
  • Zone 2: 987 ppm → ~995.5 ppm.
  • Zone 3: 980 ppm → ~987 ppm.
  • Zone 4: 848 ppm → ~858 ppm.
- Outdoor air is very hot (34.9°C), so extra OA increases cooling load significantly.
- Previous action: zone dampers high (0.75–0.9), OA damper 0.3, coil 0.8, fan 0.9.

2) Objectives trade-off for next 5 minutes:
- Comfort: already good and naturally drifting toward the 26°C center. We can slightly reduce cooling without leaving the comfort band in 5 minutes.
- CO2: main risk is Zone 1 slightly above target and slowly rising, but far from 1100 ppm. Other zones are near or below target. We should modestly improve ventilation without large energy penalty.
- Energy: fan 0.9 and coil 0.8 are aggressive given that temperatures are already stable to slightly decreasing. Reducing both will save power and still maintain comfort.

3) Strategy:
- Zone dampers: keep fairly high but can trim slightly to reduce fan power and over-ventilation of already better zones, focusing slightly more on high-CO2 zones.
  • Keep Zone 1 damper high, as it has the highest CO2 and slightly above-center temperature.
  • Zones 2 & 3: also relatively high but can be slightly lower than Zone 1.
  • Zone 4: lowest CO2; can reduce more here to cut airflow/energy while remaining comfortable.
- OA damper: modestly increase from 0.30 to about 0.35 to enhance building-level CO2 dilution without a large increase in cooling demand (only a small step change for one 5-min interval).
- Coil valve: reduce from 0.80 to around 0.65 to save chiller energy because temps are trending down already and are comfortably within band. This should still maintain comfort for the next 5 minutes.
- Fan speed: reduce from 0.90 to about 0.80 to cut fan energy while maintaining enough airflow for cooling and CO2 control.

4) Numerical choices (before clipping, then checked against bounds):
- zone_dampers: [0.88, 0.86, 0.84, 0.70]
  • All within [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.35 (within [0.05, 0.6]).
- coil_valve: 0.65 (within [0.06, 1.0]).
- fan_speed: 0.80 (within [0.45, 1.4]).

5) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Temperature: slight cooling continues but reduced somewhat due to lower coil and fan; zones remain inside 25–27°C and likely closer to 26°C.
- CO2: small improvement vs previous control because of slightly higher OA damper and still-high zone dampers, particularly for Zone 1, with very low risk of exceeding 1100 ppm.
- Energy: lower than previous step due to reduced coil and fan, improving the reward while keeping comfort and CO2 within acceptable ranges.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.86, 0.84, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.65, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state and objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C with comfort band 25–27°C. All zones are within band but mildly warm relative to 26°C:
  - Z1: 26.5°C (error +0.5)
  - Z2: 26.9°C (error +0.9)
  - Z3: 26.8°C (error +0.8)
  - Z4: 26.9°C (error +0.9)
- Temps are essentially flat (near 0°C/min), so current cooling roughly balances loads.
- CO₂:
  - Z1: 1011 ppm (above 1000 target, trend +1.3 ppm/min → +~6.5 ppm in 5 min, so ~1017.5 ppm without changes)
  - Z2: 995 ppm (just below target, trend +1.4 ppm/min → ~1002 ppm)
  - Z3: 985 ppm (trend +1.0 ppm/min → ~990 ppm)
  - Z4: 854 ppm (trend +1.1 ppm/min → ~860 ppm)
- Violation threshold is 1100 ppm; we are ~90 ppm below in Z1 with an upward trend, so we should act pre-emptively but do not need extremely aggressive changes yet.
- Outdoor air: 34.8°C, very hot relative to 26°C. More OA improves CO₂ but increases cooling load and energy.
- Previous actions:
  - Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.86, 0.84, 0.70]
  - OA damper: 0.35
  - Coil valve: 0.65
  - Fan speed: 0.80

We need to: keep comfort near 26°C, prevent CO₂ from drifting higher (especially Z1), avoid crossing 1100 ppm, and minimise fan/chiller energy. Given penalties: CO₂ violations (1100+) are heavily penalised; modest increases in power and modest over-cooling may be acceptable if they materially reduce CO₂ risk.

2) Strategy considerations for this 5-minute interval:
- CO₂ control levers: OA damper, fan speed (more total airflow → more ventilation per zone), and possibly modestly higher supply airflow to the most problematic zones via their dampers.
- Cooling/comfort levers: coil valve (supply air temperature), fan speed (airflow), and zone dampers (distribution). Because outside air is much hotter than indoor, increasing OA without also maintaining/increasing cooling could raise zone temps.
- Because all zones are warm side of 26°C and temps are flat, we can slightly increase cooling capacity and fresh air while trying not to overshoot below 25°C within a short 5-min horizon.
- Energy: fan speed has a strong cubic-ish relation to power; coil valve increase raises chiller/coil energy. We should make small, targeted increments rather than large jumps.

3) CO₂ focus by zone:
- Z1 (1011 ppm, +1.3 ppm/min): priority. Needs more ventilation.
- Z2 (995 ppm, +1.4): borderline; likely cross 1000 ppm without change. Some extra ventilation is helpful.
- Z3 (985 ppm, +1.0): moderate.
- Z4 (854 ppm): comfortable margin; can be slightly deprioritised for OA distribution.

4) Tuning actuators:
A) Outdoor air damper (bound 0.05–0.6, currently 0.35):
- Raising OA will directly lower or slow CO₂ rise, at the cost of increased cooling load because outdoor is 34.8°C.
- A moderate step up seems appropriate to protect against Z1 moving further above target. Going too high (e.g., near 0.6) would spike cooling load.
- Compromise: increase OA from 0.35 to about 0.42. This boosts fresh air ~20% relative to 0.35 while still well below max.

B) Fan speed (bound 0.45–1.4, currently 0.80):
- More fan speed increases both ventilation and cooling delivery but at significant energy cost.
- Given we also slightly increase OA and zone dampers are already relatively high, a small fan increase is enough. This also helps distribute the cooler, more oxygenated air to all zones.
- Adjust from 0.80 to 0.85. This is a modest bump that increases total ventilation and cooling capacity but avoids a big power hit.

C) Coil valve (bound 0.06–1.0, currently 0.65):
- All zones are on the warm side with flat temperatures; small extra cooling will nudge them closer to 26°C while compensating for hotter OA increase.
- However, with higher fan speed and OA, the coil load will already increase; we should make only a slight increase.
- Move from 0.65 to 0.70 to modestly lower supply air temperature and maintain comfort despite more OA.

D) Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):
We should bias airflow toward higher CO₂ and warmer zones while not starving lower-CO₂ zones.
- General comfort: Z2–Z4 are slightly warmer (26.8–26.9°C) than Z1 (26.5°C), but Z1 has the worst CO₂. For this 5-min step, prioritise CO₂ more than small temp differences, since all are inside 25–27°C.
- Z1 (26.5°C, 1011 ppm): keep high or slightly higher damper to maintain strong ventilation and cooling. Currently 0.88; we can raise slightly.
  - Set to 0.92.
- Z2 (26.9°C, 995 ppm trending up): both warm and near CO₂ target; keep high airflow.
  - Current 0.86; raise a bit to 0.90.
- Z3 (26.8°C, 985 ppm): moderate CO₂, slightly warm. Maintain or very slightly adjust.
  - Current 0.84; keep at 0.86 to support both cooling and some extra ventilation.
- Z4 (26.9°C, 854 ppm): warm but CO₂ low, so we can avoid over-prioritising airflow here compared to other zones, relying on global increases in fan speed and coil capacity.
  - Current 0.70; hold steady at 0.70 (or at most a tiny bump). Keeping it constant biases proportionally more of the additional system airflow to the higher-damper zones.

5) Check against bounds and trends:
- All proposed values are squarely within bounds:
  - Zone dampers: 0.92, 0.90, 0.86, 0.70 ∈ [0.05, 1.0]
  - OA damper: 0.42 ∈ [0.05, 0.6]
  - Coil valve: 0.70 ∈ [0.06, 1.0]
  - Fan speed: 0.85 ∈ [0.45, 1.4]
- Expected effects over next 5 minutes:
  - CO₂: higher OA + fan speed + slightly higher dampers for Z1–Z3 should reduce or flatten CO₂ trends; likely keeping Z1 close to or below its current level and keeping all zones safely under 1100 ppm.
  - Temperature: additional cooling capacity plus more mixing should gently pull temps closer to 26°C while preventing overheating from warmer OA. Given short 5-minute window, risk of dropping below 25°C is low.
  - Energy: there is a modest increase in fan and chiller energy, but justified by reduced CO₂ risk and slight comfort improvement, optimising the reward considering the heavy CO₂ penalties.

6) Final selected action:
- Use the calculated values with no further adjustments, as they already balance comfort, CO₂, and energy trade-offs for the upcoming 5-minute interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.92, 0.9, 0.86, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 0.85}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Comfort: All zones are between 26.5–26.9°C, inside comfort band (25–27°C) but slightly warm vs 26°C center. Errors: +0.5, +0.9, +0.8, +0.9°C (positive = too warm). Trends are ~0°C/min, so temps are roughly flat with the current actions.
- CO2: 997, 984, 975, 848 ppm, all below 1000 ppm target and drifting down slightly. No immediate risk of exceeding 1000 ppm, far below 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Outdoor air: 34.8°C, much hotter than indoors, so more OA hurts cooling energy and may warm supply air.
- Previous actions: zone dampers fairly high (0.92, 0.9, 0.86, 0.7), OA damper 0.42, coil valve 0.7, fan speed 0.85. These settings are holding current temperatures nearly steady.

Given RL reward design, we want: maintain temps near 26°C, avoid >27°C, CO2 <1000 ppm, and avoid unnecessary energy (fan, coil, OA).

2) Predict short-term evolution if we kept previous actions:
- With coil 0.7 and fan 0.85 and high zone flows, the zones are staying roughly constant while being slightly above 26°C. That suggests internal load is being mostly offset but not enough to pull zones down toward 26°C.
- Over the next 5 minutes, keeping the same settings would likely leave zones near 26.6–27.0°C. Zone 2 and 4 at 26.9°C risk touching 27°C+ if internal load increases, triggering comfort band penalty.
- CO2 is already trending down; current ventilation is more than enough. We can likely reduce OA damper modestly without crossing 1000 ppm in 5 minutes.

3) Strategy for this interval:
- Cooling: slightly increase cooling capacity to nudge all zones toward ~26.2–26.4°C within 5–15 minutes, avoiding overshoot below 25°C.
- Airflow distribution: prioritize slightly warmer zones (2,3,4) vs 1. But all zones are similar and above setpoint; large spatial rebalancing is unnecessary.
- Energy: we can trade a slight increase in coil valve for a small decrease in fan and OA to maintain or reduce power overall while improving comfort.

4) Actuator by actuator reasoning:
A) Coil valve (0.06–1.0):
- Currently at 0.70 with flat temperatures above setpoint, so cooling is roughly matched to load. To bring temps down a bit, increase coil somewhat.
- However, increasing coil raises chiller/pump energy cost (captured in power_kw). Since all zones are still inside comfort band and not extremely hot, a modest change is best.
- Choose coil_valve = 0.78 (slight increase from 0.70). This should reduce supply air temperature enough to start a gentle temperature decline without risking undershoot below 25°C within 5 minutes.

B) Fan speed (0.45–1.4):
- Currently 0.85. Fan power grows nonlinearly; reducing fan speed slightly reduces energy significantly while slightly lowering airflow.
- With coil increased, we can afford a small reduction in fan and still maintain or improve cooling.
- CO2 is already trending down and near 1000 ppm; lowering fan slightly may slow CO2 decay but should not cause any zone to exceed 1000 ppm within 5 minutes.
- Choose fan_speed = 0.80, a small decrease for energy savings without large comfort or CO2 risk.

C) Outdoor air damper (0.05–0.6):
- Currently 0.42 with CO2 trending downward. Outdoor air is much hotter than indoors, so OA raises cooling load.
- We want enough OA to keep CO2 below 1000 ppm with some margin, but we can likely reduce from 0.42.
- CO2 trends: roughly −2 to −2.5 ppm/min in the highest-CO2 zones. Over 5 min, that’s −10 to −12 ppm if conditions stay similar. Even if OA shrinks somewhat, it’s unlikely to reverse sign and jump above 1000 ppm in 5 minutes from ~990 ppm unless occupancy suddenly spikes.
- To be cautious but reduce energy, lower oa_damper moderately: choose oa_damper = 0.35.

D) Zone dampers (0.05–1.0 each):
Current temps and priorities:
- Z1: 26.5°C, error +0.5, CO2 997
- Z2: 26.9°C, error +0.9, CO2 984
- Z3: 26.8°C, error +0.8, CO2 975
- Z4: 26.9°C, error +0.9, CO2 848

All are warm, with Zones 2 & 4 warmest; Zone 1 is slightly better. CO2 is highest in Z1 but still below target and trending down.

We want a slight rebalancing, not aggressive changes, and some small overall reduction in total zone flow for energy savings, given we are slightly increasing coil cooling.

Adjustments:
- Zone 1 damper: currently 0.92. It's relatively cool and has highest CO2, but CO2 is still acceptable. To reduce total airflow and slightly favor warmer zones, trim Z1 damper a bit: choose 0.88.
- Zone 2 damper: currently 0.90 and among warmest. Slight increase to give it a bit more cooling, offset by reductions elsewhere: choose 0.92.
- Zone 3 damper: currently 0.86, also warm. Increase slightly: choose 0.89.
- Zone 4 damper: currently 0.70, warm and lowest CO2. Increase modestly to improve comfort there: choose 0.76.

Check the qualitative results:
- Total damper sum was 0.92 + 0.90 + 0.86 + 0.70 = 3.38
- New sum is 0.88 + 0.92 + 0.89 + 0.76 = 3.45 (slightly more total flow). But we reduced fan speed from 0.85 to 0.80 and OA damper from 0.42 to 0.35. Net energy impact is likely neutral to slightly lower, while comfort improves thanks to higher coil and better distribution.

5) Safety and bounds:
- All proposed values are within the given bounds:
  - Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.92, 0.89, 0.76] within [0.05, 1.0]
  - OA damper: 0.35 within [0.05, 0.6]
  - Coil valve: 0.78 within [0.06, 1.0]
  - Fan speed: 0.80 within [0.45, 1.4]
No clipping needed.

6) Expected effect over next 5 minutes:
- Slightly colder supply air and marginally higher flow to warmer zones should start driving all zone temps gently toward the 26°C center without overshooting the lower comfort band.
- CO2 should remain below 1000 ppm, with perhaps a slower downward trend but still safely under the target and far from violation.
- Energy is balanced: coil power up a bit, but fan and OA-driven load down a bit; overall this should be near-efficient while improving comfort and avoiding penalties.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.92, 0.89, 0.76], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.78, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

But all zones are similar and above setpoint; large spatial rebalancing is unnecessary.\n- Energy: we can trade a slight increase in coil valve for a small decrease in fan and OA to maintain or reduce power overall while improving comfort.\n\n4) Actuator by actuator reasoning:\nA) Coil valve (0.06–1.0):\n- Currently at 0.70 with flat temperatures above setpoint, so cooling is roughly matched to load. To bring temps down a bit, increase coil somewhat.\n- However, increasing coil raises chiller/pump energy cost (captured in power_kw). Since all zones are still inside comfort band and not extremely hot, a modest change is best.\n- Choose coil_valve = 0.78 (slight increase from 0.70). This should reduce supply air temperature enough to start a gentle temperature decline without risking undershoot below 25°C within 5 minutes.\n\nB) Fan speed (0.45–1.4):\n- Currently 0.85. Fan power grows nonlinearly; reducing fan speed slightly reduces energy significantly while slightly lowering airflow.\n- With coil increased, we can afford a small reduction in fan and still maintain or improve cooling.\n- CO2 is already trending down and near 1000 ppm; lowering fan slightly may slow CO2 decay but should not cause any zone to exceed 1000 ppm within 5 minutes.\n- Choose fan_speed = 0.80, a small decrease for energy savings without large comfort or CO2 risk.\n\nC) Outdoor air damper (0.05–0.6):\n- Currently 0.42 with CO2 trending downward. Outdoor air is much hotter than indoors, so OA raises cooling load.\n- We want enough OA to keep CO2 below 1000 ppm with some margin, but we can likely reduce from 0.42.\n- CO2 trends: roughly −2 to −2.5 ppm/min in the highest-CO2 zones. Over 5 min, that’s −10 to −12 ppm if conditions stay similar. Even if OA shrinks somewhat, it’s unlikely to reverse sign and jump above 1000 ppm in 5 minutes from ~990 ppm unless occupancy suddenly spikes.\n- To be cautious but reduce energy, lower oa_damper moderately: choose oa_damper = 0.35.\n\nD) Zone dampers (0.05–1.0 each):\nCurrent temps and priorities:\n- Z1: 26.5°C, error +0.5, CO2 997\n- Z2: 26.9°C, error +0.9, CO2 984\n- Z3: 26.8°C, error +0.8, CO2 975\n- Z4: 26.9°C, error +0.9, CO2 848\n\nAll are warm, with Zones 2 & 4 warmest; Zone 1 is slightly better. CO2 is highest in Z1 but still below target and trending down.\n\nWe want a slight rebalancing, not aggressive changes, and some small overall reduction in total zone flow for energy savings, given we are slightly increasing coil cooling.\n\nAdjustments:\n- Zone 1 damper: currently 0.92. It's relatively cool and has highest CO2, but CO2 is still acceptable. To reduce total airflow and slightly favor warmer zones, trim Z1 damper a bit: choose 0.88.\n- Zone 2 damper: currently 0.90 and among warmest. Slight increase to give it a bit more cooling, offset by reductions elsewhere: choose 0.92.\n- Zone 3 damper: currently 0.86, also warm. Increase slightly: choose 0.89.\n- Zone 4 damper: currently 0.70, warm and lowest CO2. Increase modestly to improve comfort there: choose 0.76.\n\nCheck the qualitative results:\n- Total damper sum was 0.92 + 0.90 + 0.86 + 0.70 = 3.38\n- New sum is 0.88 + 0.92 + 0.89 + 0.76 = 3.45 (slightly more total flow). But we reduced fan speed from 0.85 to 0.80 and OA damper from 0.42 to 0.35. Net energy impact is likely neutral to slightly lower, while comfort improves thanks to higher coil and better distribution.\n\n5) Safety and bounds:\n- All proposed values are within the given bounds:\n  - Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.92, 0.89, 0.76] within [0.05, 1.0]\n  - OA damper: 0.35 within [0.05, 0.6]\n  - Coil valve: 0.78 within [0.06, 1.0]\n  - Fan speed: 0.80 within [0.45, 1.4]\nNo clipping needed.\n\n6) Expected effect over next 5 minutes:\n- Slightly colder supply air and marginally higher flow to warmer zones should start driving all zone temps gently toward the 26°C center without overshooting the lower comfort band.\n- CO2 should remain below 1000 ppm, with perhaps a slower downward trend but still safely under the target and far from violation.\n- Energy is balanced: coil power up a bit, but fan and OA-driven load down a bit; overall this should be near-efficient while improving comfort and avoiding penalties."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and temperature assessment:
- All zones are within the comfort band (25–27°C) but slightly warm vs 26°C setpoint:
  - Z1: 26.5°C (+0.5°C, slowly rising at +0.01°C/min)
  - Z2: 26.9°C (+0.9°C, flat)
  - Z3: 26.8°C (+0.8°C, slowly rising)
  - Z4: 26.9°C (+0.9°C, flat)
- Outdoor is very hot at 34.9°C and rising; any increase in OA will strongly increase cooling load and could raise zone temps.
- Therefore, we should maintain or slightly increase cooling capacity (coil/fan) and keep OA modest to avoid heat gain.

2) CO2 assessment and projection (5-minute horizon):
- Targets: keep CO2 below 1000 ppm; big penalty and violation at >1100 ppm.
- Current levels and trends:
  - Z1: 1013 ppm, +2.8 ppm/min → +14 ppm in 5 min → ~1027 ppm (above 1000 but below 1100).
  - Z2: 986 ppm, +0.4 ppm/min → +2 ppm → ~988 ppm.
  - Z3: 987 ppm, +2.2 ppm/min → +11 ppm → ~998 ppm (close to 1000).
  - Z4: 851 ppm, +0.7 ppm/min → +3.5 ppm → ~855 ppm.
- CO2 is borderline in Z1 and Z3. However, OA damper is already at 0.35; significantly increasing OA when outdoor air is 34.9°C would raise cooling power considerably.
- Local zone dampers trade off: opening a zone damper improves both cooling and ventilation to that zone, but overall airflow is constrained by fan; we already have relatively high damper positions from previous step.
- Strategy: modest increase in ventilation effectiveness to high-CO2 zones mainly via their dampers, while keeping OA damper roughly the same or only slightly higher. Because Z1 is already above 1000 and rising fastest, it should get priority.

3) Energy / power considerations:
- Fan at 0.8 (mid-high), coil at 0.78 (strong cooling). With outdoor at 34.9°C midday, reducing coil or fan could push zone temps toward the upper limit (27°C) and worsen comfort penalty.
- The best trade-off appears to be:
  - Keep coil ~same or slightly up to counteract hot OA and hold temps ~26.5–26.8°C.
  - Keep fan roughly similar; a small change will not hugely alter power vs comfort in one 5-min step.
  - Avoid large OA increases; they would sharply increase cooling load.

4) Per-zone damper decisions:
- Baseline: previous dampers [Z1=0.88, Z2=0.92, Z3=0.89, Z4=0.76]. All are high, meaning zones are already getting substantial airflow.
- Z1: warm (26.5°C but rising) and CO2 above 1000 with fast increase. Increase damper slightly to boost both cooling and ventilation: from 0.88 → ~0.93.
- Z2: warmest (26.9°C), CO2 just below 1000 and slowly rising. It already has the highest damper at 0.92 and temperature trend is flat, so keep similar or tiny reduction to save some flow. Reduce very slightly to 0.90 to prioritize Z1 and Z3 while keeping comfort.
- Z3: 26.8°C, CO2 near 1000, rising moderately. Slightly increase damper: 0.89 → ~0.92.
- Z4: 26.9°C but low CO2 and slow trend; no strong need for more ventilation. Slightly reduce damper to save energy and airflow for high-CO2 zones: 0.76 → ~0.72.
- All stay within [0.05, 1.0]. These small adjustments should shift relative flow to more constrained zones without major energy change.

5) OA damper decision:
- Currently 0.35, bounds [0.05, 0.6]. With hot outdoor (34.9°C) and rising, the marginal cost of more OA is high.
- However, Z1/Z3 CO2 will remain near/above 1000 ppm with current trend. A small increase in OA improves CO2 while not massively raising load given coil/fan already high.
- Increase OA slightly: 0.35 → 0.38 (still well below max). This balance mildly reduces CO2 across all zones and is likely worth the small extra cooling power.

6) Coil valve decision:
- Zone temps are already toward warm side of band and outdoor is hotter than zones; we should at least maintain cooling.
- A modest increase in OA warrants maintaining or slightly increasing coil to prevent temps from drifting up.
- Increase coil a bit: 0.78 → 0.82, within [0.06, 1.0]. This keeps zones from approaching 27°C while OA is hot.

7) Fan speed decision:
- Fan at 0.8, bounds [0.45, 1.4]. Higher fan speeds: more power but better cooling/ventilation; lower speeds: less power but risk of overheating and higher CO2.
- Given already high zone dampers, a small fan increase may improve CO2 flushing and cooling efficacy, especially as we bumped OA slightly.
- But fan power grows roughly with cube of speed; big changes are costly. So adjust modestly: 0.80 → 0.84 for slightly better comfort/CO2 with limited power increase.

8) Check constraints / clipping:
- Zone dampers: [0.93, 0.90, 0.92, 0.72] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.38 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.82 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.84 within [0.45, 1.4].

9) Expected outcome over 5 minutes:
- Temperatures: slight downward or stable trend due to marginally higher cooling and airflow, keeping all zones firmly within 25–27°C around 26–26.7°C.
- CO2: additional OA and slightly higher fan plus more flow to Z1/Z3 should reduce their growth vs the current trend, helping keep them closer to or below 1000 ppm and reducing CO2 penalty, while staying well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Power: modest increases in coil and fan plus slightly higher OA will increase energy, but the gain in comfort and CO2 (especially avoiding violation penalties) should improve overall reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.93, 0.9, 0.92, 0.72], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.82, ""fan_speed"": 0.84}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1. Comfort and CO2 assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C around a 26°C center. All zones are inside the comfort band, but slightly warm:
  • Zone 1: 26.5°C (error +0.5)
  • Zone 2: 26.9°C (error +0.9)
  • Zone 3: 26.8°C (error +0.8)
  • Zone 4: 26.9°C (error +0.9)
- No strong cooling trend: all temp_deltas ≈ 0, so current cooling is roughly holding temperatures.
- CO2:
  • Zone 1: 1014 ppm (slightly above 1000 target, flat trend)
  • Zone 2: 980 ppm (below target, decreasing)
  • Zone 3: 989 ppm (just below target, slowly increasing +0.3 ppm/min)
  • Zone 4: 851 ppm (well below target)
- Violation threshold is 1100 ppm; we have margin, but Zone 1 and 3 are close to the 1000 ppm target, so we should not reduce ventilation too aggressively.

2. Energy vs. comfort/CO2 trade-off:
- Outdoor temperature = 35°C, much hotter than indoors (~27°C). Increasing OA damper too much increases sensible cooling load (hurts power term) but helps CO2.
- Current actuators:
  • Zone dampers: [0.93, 0.90, 0.92, 0.72] – already high for Zones 1–3.
  • OA damper: 0.38 on [0.05, 0.6] – moderate OA.
  • Coil valve: 0.82 on [0.06, 1.0] – strong cooling.
  • Fan speed: 0.84 on [0.45, 1.4] – moderately high.
- All zones are within comfort band, so chasing exactly 26.0°C with more cooling is not needed; we can modestly reduce energy while ensuring temps do not rise above 27°C and CO2 stays under 1000–1100 ppm.

3. Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Keep or slightly increase cooling capacity to nudge temps down toward mid-band (≈26–26.5°C) while allowing a small reduction in fan/flow to save energy.
- Maintain or slightly increase OA fraction to help CO2 in Zones 1 and 3 but avoid large increases due to 35°C outdoor air.
- Rebalance zone dampers: Zones with higher temp and higher CO2 (1 and 3) get priority; Zones 2 and 4 can be slightly reduced to save some flow, but only modestly to avoid comfort drift.

4. Concrete adjustments:
- Coil valve:
  • With all zones slightly warm and outdoor very hot, reducing coil could let temps drift upward toward 27+ in 5–10 minutes.
  • Slightly increase coil valve to strengthen cold supply air and allow a small reduction in fan while still improving comfort.
  • Move from 0.82 → 0.86 (small, conservative increase).

- Fan speed:
  • Higher fan improves both cooling delivery and CO2 removal but increases power substantially.
  • Given we slightly increase coil capacity, we can hold or slightly reduce fan to save power while keeping overall capacity similar.
  • Reduce from 0.84 → 0.80 to trim energy but still maintain strong circulation.

- OA damper:
  • Zone 1 is above CO2 target (1014 ppm, flat), Zone 3 is just below with slight upward drift.
  • We should not drop OA; a small increase helps bring CO2 under 1000 ppm while the coil handles additional sensible load.
  • Increase from 0.38 → 0.40 (small step to avoid large energy penalty while improving air quality).

- Zone dampers (relative prioritization):
  • Prioritize 1 and 3 for both cooling and ventilation.
  • Slightly reduce 2 and 4 since they are similar or lower in CO2 and similar or lower in temperature compared to 1 and 3, allowing some energy savings.

  Proposed targets:
  • Zone 1: from 0.93 → 0.95 (near max, to cool/vent the warmest, highest-CO2 zone).
  • Zone 2: from 0.90 → 0.86 (still high but slightly reduced; CO2 trending down).
  • Zone 3: from 0.92 → 0.95 (boost for temp and CO2).
  • Zone 4: from 0.72 → 0.68 (still decent flow; lowest CO2, similar temperature, so can tolerate a minor reduction).

5. Bounds check:
- Zone dampers in [0.05, 1.0]: 0.95, 0.86, 0.95, 0.68 → all within bounds.
- OA damper in [0.05, 0.6]: 0.40 → within bounds.
- Coil valve in [0.06, 1.0]: 0.86 → within bounds.
- Fan speed in [0.45, 1.4]: 0.80 → within bounds.

6. Expected outcome over 5 minutes:
- Temperatures: Slight downward drift toward ~26–26.7°C due to stronger coil and high zone flows for 1 and 3, even with a modest fan reduction.
- CO2: Small OA increase and strong flows in Zones 1 and 3 should hold them at or below ~1000 ppm and well below 1100 ppm.
- Energy: Coil power slightly up, fan slightly down, OA slightly up; net effect is a modest change but with improved comfort and CO2, likely increasing total reward relative to the previous high-flow, high-temp state.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.86, 0.95, 0.68], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.86, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1. Comfort and CO2 assessment:\n- Comfort band is 25–27°C around a 26°C center.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives
- Thermal comfort target band: 25–27°C, center 26°C.
- All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band, but on the warm side and mostly above the 26°C center:
  • Zone 1: 26.5°C (error +0.5), flat trend.
  • Zone 2: 26.9°C (error +0.9), flat trend.
  • Zone 3: 26.9°C (error +0.9), flat trend.
  • Zone 4: 27.0°C (error +1.0), very slightly increasing (+0.01°C/min ≈ +0.05°C over next 5 min).
- With hot outdoor air (35.1°C and rising), zones will tend to warm without enough cooling.
- CO2:
  • Z1: 1013 ppm, slightly decreasing.
  • Z2: 977 ppm, decreasing more notably.
  • Z3: 989 ppm, flat and just under 1000 ppm target.
  • Z4: 851 ppm, fine.
- So main concerns: keep temps from drifting further above 26–27°C while keeping CO2 <1000 ppm and avoiding unnecessary energy.

2) Assess current actuator settings and their effects
Previous action:
- Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.86, 0.95, 0.68]
  • High flows to Zones 1, 2, 3; moderate to Zone 4.
  • This likely provides strong cooling but also higher fan power.
- OA damper: 0.40 (on a 0.05–0.60 range)
  • Moderate-to-high outside air fraction; increases ventilation (good for CO2) but also raises cooling load because OA is 35.1°C.
- Coil valve: 0.86 (0.06–1.0)
  • High chilled-water valve signal; strong cooling and chiller/pump power.
- Fan speed: 0.80 (0.45–1.4)
  • Above minimum but not extreme; still nontrivial fan energy.

Given zones are still slightly warm at these fairly aggressive cooling settings, we must be careful not to reduce cooling too much, but we can refine distribution and ventilation for CO2 control vs energy.

3) Zone-by-zone strategy
Objective: Bring zones closer to 26°C center (small negative temp deltas preferred to counter warm outdoor), avoid CO2 rising above target, and reduce energy moderately.

- Zone 1: 26.5°C, 1013 ppm (slightly above 1000), CO2 decreasing.
  • Thermal: slightly warm; additional slight cooling is fine.
  • CO2: above target but trending down with high damper and OA=0.40.
  • We can keep flow high but maybe a tiny reduction vs 0.95 to save some fan energy without hurting CO2 much, since CO2 is already decreasing.

- Zone 2: 26.9°C, 977 ppm, CO2 decreasing.
  • Thermal: warmer than Z1 and closer to top of band.
  • CO2: below target and decreasing; less critical for ventilation.
  • Consider slightly higher flow than Z1 to prioritize temperature; but not huge change from previous, to avoid oscillations and extra fan energy.

- Zone 3: 26.9°C, 989 ppm, flat CO2.
  • Thermal: same as Z2.
  • CO2: near target and not decreasing; we should maintain or slightly increase flow/ventilation vs previous to avoid crossing above 1000 and trending up.
  • Prioritize both cooling and ventilation here.

- Zone 4: 27.0°C (and rising), 851 ppm.
  • Thermal: at upper comfort boundary and trending slightly up; should get more cooling.
  • CO2: comfortably below target; less need for very high outside air for this zone.
  • Increase its damper somewhat to improve cooling, but we can rely on system-level OA + coil rather than over-ventilating.

Net damper strategy:
- Slight rebalancing, not drastic cuts, because all zones are warm.
- Proposed approximate relative priorities (highest flow): Z4 ≳ Z3 ≳ Z2 ≳ Z1.
- Also watch that raising all dampers too high pushes fan energy and may necessitate lower coil to avoid overcooling; but given all zones are warm, some increase to Z3/Z4 while slightly trimming Z1 is reasonable.

Candidate damper setpoints:
- Z1: slight reduction from 0.95 → 0.90.
- Z2: maintain or very slight increase 0.86 → 0.88 (prioritize temp but CO2 is good).
- Z3: slight increase 0.95 → 0.98 to help CO2 and temp.
- Z4: increase 0.68 → 0.80 to address highest temp and upward trend.
All within [0.05, 1.0].

4) Outdoor air damper strategy
- Outdoor temp 35.1°C, hotter than indoor zones, and trending up. More OA increases chiller and fan loads.
- CO2 status: only Zone 1 is marginally above 1000 but decreasing; Z3 is just below and flat; others are fine.
- With relatively high zone dampers + decent fan, reducing OA slightly should still keep CO2 under control while saving energy and cooling load.
- We should avoid big OA drops that might let Z1/Z3 CO2 climb.
- Previous OA = 0.40 (range 0.05–0.60). Consider a modest reduction to about 0.35 to lower energy while staying safe on CO2, given:
  • Z1’s CO2 is already trending down.
  • Z3 is just under 1000; combined with slight increase in Z3 damper and steady or slightly higher fan, 0.35 OA should likely hold or improve CO2.

5) Coil valve (cooling capacity) strategy
- All zone temperatures are above 26°C; no sign of overcooling anywhere.
- With hot outdoor air and mid-day solar gains, we should maintain strong but slightly optimized cooling.
- Current coil = 0.86 (on 0.06–1.0). Comfort would benefit from similar or slightly higher cooling to gently pull temps toward 26–26.5°C.
- But increasing coil further will increase chiller/pump energy. Since reward penalizes power, we only increase if clearly needed.
- Given zones are just moderately warm (not >27.5°C) and their trends are flat/slightly positive, a small increase might counter the warming outdoor trend without a big energy hit.
- However, we are also raising some zone dampers and maintaining fan speed; that increases airflow, improving sensible cooling delivery even with the same coil.
- To balance, choose a very modest upward adjustment in coil valve to slightly reinforce cooling while OA is reduced:
  • Coil: 0.86 → 0.88 (tiny change, mostly maintaining strong cooling while allowing OA cut).

6) Fan speed strategy
- Current fan = 0.80 (0.45–1.4).
- Warmer zones + slightly increased dampers in key zones suggest we should not reduce fan, as it would hurt comfort and CO2.
- Increasing fan further would improve cooling and CO2 but at quadratic energy cost; with temps only slightly warm and CO2 near acceptable, energy penalty might outweigh comfort gains.
- With damper rebalancing and coil slightly up, keeping fan at 0.80 is a good compromise.

7) Check overall tradeoffs for reward
- Comfort: Slightly increased cooling capacity and better flow where hottest or dirtiest (Z3/Z4) should move temps slightly down toward 26°C and keep all within comfort band.
- CO2: Slight OA reduction is offset by:
  • Slightly higher Z3 damper for a near-target zone.
  • Moderate-to-high fan and overall high zone flows.
  • Zones 1 and 2 already have decreasing CO2 trends.
  So peak CO2 should remain <1000–1050, with low risk of violation threshold 1100.
- Power: We reduce OA fraction (good for chiller energy) and do not raise fan; only a very small coil increase. Net effect likely reduces or roughly maintains power vs previous while improving comfort distribution.

8) Final action selection and bounds checking
- Zone dampers (proposed): [0.90, 0.88, 0.98, 0.80]
  • All within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.35 within [0.05, 0.60].
- Coil valve: 0.88 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.80 within [0.45, 1.4].
These are already within bounds; no clipping needed.

This set targets slightly improved comfort and stable CO2 with small energy savings from lower OA, aiming to maximize the combined reward over the next 5-minute interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.88, 0.98, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.88, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Net effect likely reduces or roughly maintains power vs previous while improving comfort distribution.\n\n8) Final action selection and bounds checking\n- Zone dampers (proposed): [0.90, 0.88, 0.98, 0.80]\n  • All within [0.05, 1.0].\n- OA damper: 0.35 within [0.05, 0.60].\n- Coil valve: 0.88 within [0.06, 1.0].\n- Fan speed: 0.80 within [0.45, 1.4].\nThese are already within bounds; no clipping needed.\n\nThis set targets slightly improved comfort and stable CO2 with small energy savings from lower OA, aiming to maximize the combined reward over the next 5-minute interval."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret objectives and current state:
- Comfort: target 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C. All zones are within band but slightly warm:
  • Z1: 26.5°C (error +0.5, slowly warming +0.01°C/min)
  • Z2: 26.9°C (error +0.9, flat)
  • Z3: 26.9°C (error +0.9, flat)
  • Z4: 26.9°C (error +0.9, slowly cooling -0.01°C/min)
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation threshold 1100 ppm.
  • Z1: 1025 ppm and rising +2.2 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ 1036 ppm (above target, below violation)
  • Z2: 984 ppm → ≈ 990 ppm (just below 1000)
  • Z3: 997 ppm → ≈ 1005 ppm (slightly above target)
  • Z4: 853 ppm → ≈ 855 ppm (comfortable)
- Outdoor: 35.3°C and rising → hot outside, so economizer-style heavy OA is undesirable for cooling energy.
- Previous actions (relatively aggressive cooling/flow):
  • zone_dampers: [0.9, 0.88, 0.98, 0.8]
  • oa_damper: 0.35
  • coil_valve: 0.88
  • fan_speed: 0.8
System is providing strong cooling and airflow; zones are near upper edge of comfort.

2) Strategy trade-offs for reward:
Reward = comfort_reward - comfort_penalty*band_penalty - 0.2*power_kw - 0.5*co2_penalty - co2_violation_penalty.
- Comfort: Slightly warm zones → mild penalty, but still within band; modest extra cooling will reduce band_penalty and improve comfort reward.
- CO2: We should reduce and reverse positive CO2 trends via ventilation, but OA is hot, so OA increases cooling load. However, fan speed also affects zone ventilation via mixing of supply air.
- Energy: Coil valve at 0.88 and fan at 0.8 are high. There is room to trim both while still maintaining or slightly improving comfort if we manage damper distribution.
- Constraints: OA damper max 0.6; fan min 0.45; coil min 0.06; zone dampers [0.05,1.0].

3) Zone-by-zone reasoning:
- Zone 1: Warm (26.5°C), CO2 already above 1000 and rising fastest. Needs both cooling and more ventilation. We should keep a high damper (near current 0.9) and rely on global OA + fan to dilute CO2.
- Zone 2: Warmest (26.9°C) but CO2 ~990 and only slightly increasing; it will hover around target. Keep relatively high damper to maintain comfort; no need to further increase.
- Zone 3: Similar to Z2 temperature, CO2 ≈997 and projected slightly above 1000; keep damper high.
- Zone 4: Warm but slightly cooling and low CO2. We can modestly reduce damper to redirect some airflow capacity and save fan-related distribution energy without hurting comfort in 5 minutes.

4) Outdoor air damper decision:
- OA at 0.35 with 35.3°C OA implies large cooling load. However, CO2 in multiple zones is at/above target, so we need somewhat more OA to bend CO2 trends down and avoid later violation penalties.
- Increasing OA slightly (e.g., to 0.4–0.45) provides better CO2 control without going near the max 0.6, limiting cooling penalty.
- Given Z1 CO2 trend is steep and multiple zones are near 1000, lean slightly more aggressive on OA: choose 0.45.

5) Coil valve decision (cooling capacity):
- All zones are in upper part of comfort band and OA is very hot. We want to keep supply air cool enough to nudge temps back toward ~26°C.
- With an increase in OA (hot), we should not reduce coil valve too much or zones may warm further. A slight reduction from 0.88 to around 0.8 balances comfort and energy.
- 0.8 provides strong cooling but saves some chiller energy relative to 0.88.

6) Fan speed decision:
- Fan at 0.8 is fairly high. Fan speed affects both energy use and effective ventilation in zones.
- Given we are increasing OA damper to 0.45, we can slightly reduce fan while maintaining adequate ventilation. But we must be cautious because multiple zones are near CO2 target and warm; too low fan would worsen both.
- A small reduction to ~0.75 maintains strong airflow while reducing power somewhat.

7) Zone damper setpoints:
Goal: Prioritize airflow to CO2- and comfort-critical zones while trimming where safe.
- Z1: High temp & highest CO2; keep very high damper, maybe slight increase from 0.9 to 0.95 to ensure priority, within [0.05,1].
- Z2: Warm with near-target CO2; maintain about current level; perhaps 0.9 (slight up from 0.88) to ensure comfort with slightly reduced fan.
- Z3: Warm and CO2 slightly under 1000 but trending upward; already at 0.98; no need to go to 1.0; keep 0.98 to avoid maxing unnecessarily.
- Z4: Warm but cooling and low CO2; can reduce to free capacity/energy; drop from 0.8 to 0.7. This is still high, so comfort should be fine over 5 minutes, especially with strong coil cooling.

This distribution, combined with modestly reduced fan speed and coil, and increased OA, should:
- Cool zones slightly towards 26°C center.
- Improve CO2 trajectories (especially with OA=0.45 and solid airflow).
- Reduce energy somewhat versus previous aggressive coil/fan settings, avoiding excessive OA that would spike chiller load.

8) Bounds check and final values:
- Zone dampers bounds [0.05, 1.0]:
  • Z1 = 0.95 → within bounds
  • Z2 = 0.9 → within bounds
  • Z3 = 0.98 → within bounds
  • Z4 = 0.7 → within bounds
- OA damper bounds [0.05, 0.6]:
  • oa_damper = 0.45 → within bounds
- Coil valve bounds [0.06, 1.0]:
  • coil_valve = 0.8 → within bounds
- Fan speed bounds [0.45, 1.4]:
  • fan_speed = 0.75 → within bounds.

These setpoints reflect a controlled, slightly more ventilation-focused operation while trimming energy use compared to the previous interval, and should improve the overall reward over the next 5 minutes.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.9, 0.98, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort vs setpoint and band:
- Comfort center is 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps: Z1 26.6, Z2 26.9, Z3 26.9, Z4 27.0°C.
- All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band but biased on the warm side, slightly above the 26°C center. Trend is essentially flat to slightly warming (0–0.01°C/min), so without enough cooling, zones may drift above 27°C.

2) CO₂ status and trend:
- Current CO₂: Z1 1020 ppm (>1000 target), Z2 976, Z3 993, Z4 848.
- All are trending down: deltas −1.1, −1.3, −0.8, −1.0 ppm/min.
- Over 5 minutes this is roughly −5 to −6.5 ppm, so Z1 will likely drop to ~1014 ppm, still slightly above target but safely below the 1100 ppm violation threshold. Others should remain under or near 1000 with downward trend.
- This means we do not need a strong increase in ventilation (OA or zone dampers) specifically for CO₂ control right now; we just must avoid actions that significantly worsen CO₂.

3) Energy vs comfort trade-off:
- Reward penalizes power (weight 0.2) and CO₂, plus comfort deviation. We want to keep temperatures near 26°C, avoid creeping above 27°C, but not overcool since that increases energy use.
- Current actuators: zone dampers [0.95, 0.90, 0.98, 0.70], OA damper 0.45, coil valve 0.80, fan speed 0.75.
- These are relatively aggressive (high cooling and airflow). Given zones are warm side but already within band and not strongly rising, we can aim for a slight net cooling bias to bring temps closer to 26°C, while trimming outdoor air and fan energy somewhat.

4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Zones are slightly warm and we’re in mid-day with hot outdoor air (35.1°C). Heat gains will be non-trivial; we should not reduce cooling too much or temps can exceed 27°C, which would hurt comfort.
- CO₂ is near target and trending down, so we can slightly reduce OA fraction to save energy without risking a violation.
- Fan speed can likely be trimmed a bit to reduce power while still maintaining enough airflow because current damper positions are high, which suggests ducts are not starved.
- Coil valve: maintain or slightly adjust around current 0.8 to ensure adequate but not excessive cooling.

5) Zone damper decisions:
- Z1 (26.6°C, 1020 ppm): Slightly above setpoint, CO₂ above target but falling. Keep damper high to provide cooling and ventilation. Current 0.95 is near max; slight reduction will reduce fan power demand while maintaining strong flow.
- Z2 (26.9°C, 976 ppm): Warmer, near top of comfort band, CO₂ under target and falling. Needs cooling; keep damper fairly high but we can trim a bit relative to 0.90.
- Z3 (26.9°C, 993 ppm): Similar to Z2, close to 1000 ppm, warmer. Keep damper high.
- Z4 (27.0°C, 848 ppm): At top of band, good CO₂, delta temp slightly positive. Increase damper modestly from 0.70 to provide more cooling.
- Overall: maintain high-ish dampers but modestly re-balance and slightly reduce the most open ones to save some fan energy while boosting Z4.

6) OA damper decision:
- Current 0.45; bounds [0.05, 0.6]. Outdoor air is much hotter (35.1°C) than zones (~27°C), so more OA increases cooling load.
- CO₂ trends are downward and below violation threshold, so we can safely reduce OA a bit while staying within fresh air needs implicitly assumed by the bounds. This reduces chiller and fan energy.
- Move OA damper from 0.45 to about 0.38–0.40 as a conservative energy-saving step that should not reverse the CO₂ downward trends sharply in just 5 minutes.

7) Coil valve decision:
- Current coil 0.80 in hot conditions is fairly high. Zones are just slightly above setpoint with marginal upward trends. Reducing coil too much could push them over 27°C within or shortly after this interval, hurting comfort reward.
- Better to keep coil at 0.80 for now to gently pull zone temps back toward 26°C, especially since we’re slightly trimming fan and OA.
- So hold coil_valve at 0.80.

8) Fan speed decision:
- Current fan 0.75, bounds [0.45, 1.4]. With dampers largely open, static pressure demand should be moderate. A small reduction to ~0.70 reduces energy with limited comfort impact for 5 minutes.
- Larger reduction (e.g., to 0.6) risks slower CO₂ removal and less cooling to the warmest zones, possibly letting temps exceed 27°C.
- Choose fan_speed 0.70.

9) Final actuator values (clipped to bounds):
- Zone dampers bounds [0.05, 1.0]. Choose:
  * Z1: 0.90 (slightly down from 0.95, still high for cooling and ventilation).
  * Z2: 0.85 (slightly down from 0.90).
  * Z3: 0.93 (slightly down from 0.98, still very high due to high temp and near-target CO₂).
  * Z4: 0.78 (up from 0.70 to cool the warmest, low-CO₂ zone).
- OA damper: 0.40 (within [0.05, 0.6]).
- Coil valve: 0.80 (within [0.06, 1.0]).
- Fan speed: 0.70 (within [0.45, 1.4]).

10) Expected effect over next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures should slightly decrease or at least stabilize closer to 26–26.5°C due to sustained coil capacity and still-high zone flows, with some extra focus on Zone 4.
- CO₂ should continue slowly decreasing or stay near current levels, as total ventilation remains significant even with a small OA reduction.
- Fan and chiller energy should be reduced modestly via lower fan speed, slightly lower zone flows in the already high-flow zones, and lower OA percentage.
- Overall, this balances maintaining comfort and CO₂ under constraints while enhancing reward via energy savings.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.85, 0.93, 0.78], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1) Comfort vs setpoint and band:\n- Comfort center is 26°C, band 25–27°C.\n- Zone temps: Z1 26.6, Z2 26.9, Z3 26.9, Z4 27.0°C.\n- All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band but biased on the warm side, slightly above the 26°C center. Trend is essentially flat to slightly warming (0–0.01°C/min), so without enough cooling, zones may drift above 27°C.\n\n2) CO₂ status and trend:\n- Current CO₂: Z1 1020 ppm (>1000 target), Z2 976, Z3 993, Z4 848.\n- All are trending down: deltas −1.1, −1.3, −0.8, −1.0 ppm/min.\n- Over 5 minutes this is roughly −5 to −6.5 ppm, so Z1 will likely drop to ~1014 ppm, still slightly above target but safely below the 1100 ppm violation threshold. Others should remain under or near 1000 with downward trend.\n- This means we do not need a strong increase in ventilation (OA or zone dampers) specifically for CO₂ control right now; we just must avoid actions that significantly worsen CO₂.\n\n3) Energy vs comfort trade-off:\n- Reward penalizes power (weight 0.2) and CO₂, plus comfort deviation. We want to keep temperatures near 26°C, avoid creeping above 27°C, but not overcool since that increases energy use.\n- Current actuators: zone dampers [0.95, 0.90, 0.98, 0.70], OA damper 0.45, coil valve 0.80, fan speed 0.75.\n- These are relatively aggressive (high cooling and airflow). Given zones are warm side but already within band and not strongly rising, we can aim for a slight net cooling bias to bring temps closer to 26°C, while trimming outdoor air and fan energy somewhat.\n\n4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:\n- Zones are slightly warm and we’re in mid-day with hot outdoor air (35.1°C). Heat gains will be non-trivial; we should not reduce cooling too much or temps can exceed 27°C, which would hurt comfort.\n- CO₂ is near target and trending down, so we can slightly reduce OA fraction to save energy without risking a violation.\n- Fan speed can likely be trimmed a bit to reduce power while still maintaining enough airflow because current damper positions are high, which suggests ducts are not starved.\n- Coil valve: maintain or slightly adjust around current 0.8 to ensure adequate but not excessive cooling.\n\n5) Zone damper decisions:\n- Z1 (26.6°C, 1020 ppm): Slightly above setpoint, CO₂ above target but falling. Keep damper high to provide cooling and ventilation. Current 0.95 is near max; slight reduction will reduce fan power demand while maintaining strong flow.\n- Z2 (26.9°C, 976 ppm): Warmer, near top of comfort band, CO₂ under target and falling. Needs cooling; keep damper fairly high but we can trim a bit relative to 0.90.\n- Z3 (26.9°C, 993 ppm): Similar to Z2, close to 1000 ppm, warmer. Keep damper high.\n- Z4 (27.0°C, 848 ppm): At top of band, good CO₂, delta temp slightly positive. Increase damper modestly from 0.70 to provide more cooling.\n- Overall: maintain high-ish dampers but modestly re-balance and slightly reduce the most open ones to save some fan energy while boosting Z4.\n\n6) OA damper decision:\n- Current 0.45; bounds [0.05, 0.6]. Outdoor air is much hotter (35.1°C) than zones (~27°C), so more OA increases cooling load.\n- CO₂ trends are downward and below violation threshold, so we can safely reduce OA a bit while staying within fresh air needs implicitly assumed by the bounds. This reduces chiller and fan energy.\n- Move OA damper from 0.45 to about 0.38–0.40 as a conservative energy-saving step that should not reverse the CO₂ downward trends sharply in just 5 minutes.\n\n7) Coil valve decision:\n- Current coil 0.80 in hot conditions is fairly high. Zones are just slightly above setpoint with marginal upward trends. Reducing coil too much could push them over 27°C within or shortly after this interval, hurting comfort reward.\n- Better to keep coil at 0.80 for now to gently pull zone temps back toward 26°C, especially since we’re slightly trimming fan and OA.\n- So hold coil_valve at 0.80.\n\n8) Fan speed decision:\n- Current fan 0.75, bounds [0.45, 1.4]. With dampers largely open, static pressure demand should be moderate. A small reduction to ~0.70 reduces energy with limited comfort impact for 5 minutes.\n- Larger reduction (e.g., to 0.6) risks slower CO₂ removal and less cooling to the warmest zones, possibly letting temps exceed 27°C.\n- Choose fan_speed 0.70.\n\n9) Final actuator values (clipped to bounds):\n- Zone dampers bounds [0.05, 1.0].

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- Comfort: All zones are slightly warm vs 26°C setpoint. Temps: Z1=26.6, Z2=26.9, Z3=27.0, Z4=27.0. Trends are very mild warming (~0.01°C/min), so without extra cooling they will remain at or drift above upper comfort band (27°C).
- CO2: Z1=1032 ppm (above 1000 target), Z3=1002 ppm (slightly above), Z2=984 ppm (just below but rising), Z4=848 ppm (fine). Trends show CO2 rising in Z1, Z2, Z3, almost flat in Z4. Violation threshold is 1100 ppm; Z1 is closest.
- Outdoor: 35°C, much hotter than indoors, so aggressive outdoor air increases cooling load. However, we still need sufficient OA to manage CO2 in some zones.
- Previous action: dampers are already fairly open (0.78–0.93), OA damper 0.4, coil valve 0.8, fan 0.7.

2) Objectives for next 5 minutes:
- Bring temps back toward 26°C while avoiding overshoot and excessive power use.
- Reduce or at least arrest growth of CO2 in Z1 and Z3 in particular, keep all zones safely below 1100 ppm.
- Minimize fan/chiller energy: avoid unnecessarily high fan speed or coil valve position while still meeting comfort/CO2.

3) Strategy considerations:
- Cooling: Indoor temps are high and trending slightly upward; coil valve at 0.8 suggests strong cooling already, but given high outdoor temp and relatively small temp drifts, a small increase in cooling plus slightly higher airflow should start pulling zones back toward 26–26.5°C. We must avoid maxing out coil valve unless clearly needed because of power_weight.
- Fan speed: Increasing fan increases airflow to zones and through OA damper, aiding both temperature and CO2 control but costs power roughly with cube of speed. A modest increment from 0.7 to around 0.8 is a good compromise to boost ventilation and cooling while not too expensive.
- Outdoor air damper: Raising OA above 0.4 improves CO2 control but brings in very hot air, forcing more chiller energy. Since Z1 and Z3 are just above 1000 ppm and we have only 5 minutes, a moderate increase (e.g., 0.45) should improve dilution without a large energy penalty. Jumping near the 0.6 max would be excessive given current CO2 levels (still far from 1100).
- Zone dampers: They are near the upper range already. To prioritize zones with worse conditions:
  * Z1: High temp (26.6) and CO2>1000 and rising → keep very open, maybe slight increase toward 1.0.
  * Z2: Temp 26.9 and CO2 just under 1000 but rising → keep relatively open but not necessarily max.
  * Z3: Temp 27.0 and CO2>1000 → prioritize cooling/ventilation similar to Z1, near max.
  * Z4: Temp 27.0 but CO2 fine and nearly flat → can maintain slightly lower damper to reduce unnecessary airflow/energy.
- Because total air is limited by fan and system, slightly bias more air to Z1 and Z3 and not increase Z4 helps both comfort and CO2 in critical zones without raising system flow too much.

4) Concrete setpoint choices (before clipping):
- Fan speed: increase modestly from 0.7 to 0.8 to strengthen cooling and ventilation.
- Coil valve: increase slightly from 0.8 to 0.85 for more cooling capacity without going near 1.0.
- OA damper: increase from 0.4 to 0.45 to assist CO2 reduction, but avoid higher values due to 35°C outdoor air.
- Zone dampers:
  * Z1: from 0.9 to 0.95 to prioritize cooling and CO2 control.
  * Z2: from 0.85 to 0.88: modest increase due to high temp and approaching 1000 ppm.
  * Z3: from 0.93 to 0.97: prioritize both temp and CO2.
  * Z4: keep at 0.78: adequate for cooling, CO2 is already good, no need to increase.

5) Check against bounds and clip:
- Zone dampers bounds [0.05, 1.0]: 0.95, 0.88, 0.97, 0.78 are all within range.
- OA damper bounds [0.05, 0.6]: 0.45 is within range.
- Coil valve bounds [0.06, 1.0]: 0.85 is within range.
- Fan speed bounds [0.45, 1.4]: 0.8 is within range.

6) Expected near-term effect:
- Temps: Increased coil and fan with high zone damper openings for the warmest zones should begin pulling them back toward the 26–26.5°C range over the next 5 minutes, moving them inside the comfort band and reducing band_penalty.
- CO2: Slightly higher OA and fan speed increases ventilation per zone; with Z1 and Z3 dampers very open, their CO2 rise should slow or reverse, likely keeping them comfortably below the 1100 ppm violation threshold and reducing co2_penalty.
- Power: Incremental increases in fan and coil are moderate, so added power_kw cost should be outweighed by improvements in comfort and CO2 for the reward function.

Thus, these actions balance comfort improvement, CO2 control, and energy.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.88, 0.97, 0.78], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.85, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort/temperature assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C with a center at 26°C.
- Current zone temperatures:
  • Zone 1: 26.7°C (0.7°C above setpoint, inside upper half of comfort band)
  • Zone 2: 26.9°C (0.9°C above setpoint, close to upper band edge)
  • Zone 3: 27.0°C (1.0°C above setpoint, right at upper band limit)
  • Zone 4: 27.0°C (also at upper band limit)
- Temperature trends (°C/min) are very small: +0.01, 0.0, +0.01, 0.0. Over 5 minutes that is ~0.05°C or less. However, without cooling, rising outdoor temperature (35.3°C and increasing) will tend to push zones upward.
- To maximize comfort reward, we should slightly cool zones towards 26°C while avoiding overcooling. All zones are at or just below the upper limit; slight additional cooling is appropriate.

2) CO2 assessment:
- CO2 levels and trends:
  • Zone 1: 1019 ppm, trend -2.3 ppm/min → over 5 min ≈ -11.5 ppm → projected ≈ 1007 ppm.
  • Zone 2: 974 ppm, trend -1.9 ppm/min → ≈ -9.5 ppm → projected ≈ 965 ppm.
  • Zone 3: 994 ppm, trend -1.6 ppm/min → ≈ -8 ppm → projected ≈ 986 ppm.
  • Zone 4: 838 ppm, trend -1.9 ppm/min → ≈ -9.5 ppm → projected ≈ 828 ppm.
- Zone 1 is slightly above the 1000 ppm target but trending down even with current OA and ventilation. Others are below 1000 and trending down.
- No imminent risk of crossing the 1100 ppm violation threshold; therefore, we can prioritize energy savings and temperature control while maintaining enough OA to keep CO2 drifting downward.

3) Energy use considerations:
- Previous actions:
  • Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.88, 0.97, 0.78] (quite open, high air volume → more fan power)
  • OA damper: 0.45 (moderate outdoor air fraction; with very hot outdoor air, this raises cooling load)
  • Coil valve: 0.85 (strong cooling → high chiller/pump power)
  • Fan speed: 0.80 (elevated fan power)
- To reduce energy while maintaining comfort and CO2 below 1000 ppm:
  • Slightly reduce coil valve and fan speed to lower power, but not so much that temperatures climb above 27°C in the next 5 min.
  • OA damper can be reduced modestly because CO2 is already trending down; lowering OA fraction in hot weather cuts cooling load.
  • Zone dampers can be trimmed slightly from near-maximum openings to reduce fan power, leveraging the still-strong coil cooling.

4) Strategy for next 5-minute interval:
- Temperature control requirement: zones are at or just within the upper band and outdoors is hot; we should maintain a reasonably cool supply air while slightly reducing airflow and OA fraction.
- CO2 requirement: keep Zone 1 safely below 1000 ppm over time; the current downward trend suggests that we can reduce OA a bit as long as we don’t completely starve ventilation.
- Smoothness: avoid abrupt changes to prevent oscillations and maintain stable conditions.

5) Concrete adjustments:
- Coil valve:
  • Currently 0.85. Temperatures are slightly above setpoint and we expect heat gain from hot outdoors. A very large reduction might push zones above 27°C.
  • Choose a moderate reduction to 0.80 to reduce energy slightly while still delivering cool supply air. This maintains cooling capacity but avoids over-aggressive chiller use.
- Fan speed:
  • Currently 0.80, with zone dampers mostly wide open. Slightly lower fan speed will cut fan power; the small temp errors and strong cooling coil can still handle loads.
  • Set fan speed to 0.75 to reduce energy modestly while maintaining adequate ventilation and cooling distribution.
- OA damper:
  • Currently 0.45. Given outdoor is 35.3°C and rising, high OA is costly. CO2 in Zone 1 is just over 1000 ppm but trending down; others are safely below.
  • Reduce OA modestly to 0.40, keeping substantial outside air to continue downward CO2 trends while easing cooling load.
- Zone dampers:
  • They are already high, and all zones are at similar or slightly elevated temps relative to setpoint.
  • Slight uniform reduction from very high values will reduce total flow and fan energy, while the coil and fan still provide sufficient cooling over 5 min.
  • Adjust:
    - Zone 1: 0.95 → 0.90 (still high to address its slightly higher CO2 and temp)
    - Zone 2: 0.88 → 0.85
    - Zone 3: 0.97 → 0.92 (zone at top of band, but very small trend; cooling air is still strong)
    - Zone 4: 0.78 → 0.75
- All values are within the given bounds and represent modest changes focused on lowering energy while keeping temps within band and CO2 satisfactory.

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures: Coil still strong (0.80) and fans only marginally reduced; with slightly reduced but still high zone damper positions, zones should stay in or move slightly toward the 26°C center rather than drifting above 27°C.
- CO2: Slightly lower OA may slightly reduce the downward CO2 slope, but given all zones already trending down and still significant OA and fan flow, CO2 should remain at or below current levels and well below violation threshold.
- Energy: Lower coil valve, fan speed, OA fraction, and slightly reduced zone dampers collectively reduce fan and cooling energy, improving the power term in the reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.85, 0.92, 0.75], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- All zones are slightly too warm:
  • Z1: 26.7°C (upper edge), trending +0.01°C/min ⇒ ~+0.05°C over next 5 min → ~26.75°C.
  • Z2: 27.0°C (at upper limit), trending to ~27.05°C.
  • Z3: 27.1°C (just above band), trending to ~27.15°C.
  • Z4: 27.0°C, trending to ~27.05°C.
So without more cooling, zones will drift slightly further above the comfort band, especially Z2–Z3.

2) CO₂ status and risk:
- Targets: <1000 ppm (soft target), violation at 1100 ppm.
- Current:
  • Z1: 1025 ppm, rising +0.9 ppm/min → +4.5 ppm ⇒ ~1029.5 ppm.
  • Z2: 977 ppm, +0.6/min → ~980 ppm.
  • Z3: 998 ppm, +0.7/min → ~1001.5 ppm.
  • Z4: 839 ppm, +0.3/min → ~840.5 ppm.
- Z1 already above 1000; Z3 about to cross 1000. No zone is near 1100, so violation penalty is not an immediate risk, but CO₂ penalty weight is non-trivial, so we should gently increase ventilation.

3) Outdoor and plant conditions:
- Outdoor temp: 35.6°C and rising (trend +3.6°C/h). So outdoor air is much hotter than indoor. Any increase in outdoor air will raise cooling load significantly.
- Previous actions:
  • Zone dampers: [0.9, 0.85, 0.92, 0.75] – already fairly open, with Z1 and Z3 highest.
  • OA damper: 0.4 (moderate outdoor air fraction).
  • Coil valve: 0.8 (strong cooling).
  • Fan speed: 0.75 (moderate-high flow).
- Since space temps are still drifting up slightly despite strong cooling, load is high. To bring temps back toward 26°C and relieve incipient CO₂ issues, we likely need more airflow and slightly more coil, while being cautious with outdoor air because it is very hot.

4) Trade-off reasoning (reward components):
- Comfort_reward: maximized when temperatures near 26°C with low variance.
  • Zones are warm and drifting warmer; comfort penalty will worsen if we keep current settings or reduce cooling.
- CO₂_penalty: Z1>1000, Z3≈1000; more ventilation (outdoor air + fan) helps, but hot OA increases chiller energy.
- Power_weight (0.2): encourages energy savings but is smaller than comfort_penalty (2.0) and co2_penalty_weight (0.5). Given we are already at or beyond the upper comfort band, improving comfort and CO₂ should have priority over minor extra energy.
- CO₂ violation penalty (10) is large but not imminent within 5 minutes. Still, letting trends continue without adjustment could create issues in later intervals.

5) Control strategy for next 5 minutes:
Goal: Slightly strengthen cooling capacity and ventilation, but in a targeted way to minimize energy.

a) Zone dampers (per-zone airflow distribution):
- Z1: Slightly warm and highest CO₂. Already at 0.90. Keep high or slightly increase to prioritize both cooling and dilution.
  • But we are near max 1.0; a small increase to 0.95 improves local conditions without large system change.
- Z2: Warm (27°C) but CO₂ <1000. Keeps needing cooling; 0.85 is fairly high. Maintain to not starve it, maybe a minor bump is optional but energy-costly. Keep at 0.85 to avoid over-supplying relative to higher-priority zones.
- Z3: Warmest and almost at CO₂ 1000. Highest damper (0.92). Increase slightly to 0.96 to give more cooling and ventilation.
- Z4: Warm but CO₂ relatively low. At 0.75, it can likely stay; increasing here doesn't help much on CO₂ and would increase total flow/energy. Keep at 0.75.
- These choices maintain a high but slightly more aggressive focus on Z1 and Z3 for both cooling and CO₂.

b) OA damper (outdoor air fraction):
- Outdoor 35.6°C is much hotter than indoor; increasing OA significantly will increase chiller load.
- However, Z1 and Z3 near/above CO₂ target; we need some improvement in ventilation.
- Move OA damper from 0.40 to 0.45 (a modest increase). This will:
  • Improve average CO₂ slightly.
  • Avoid a big jump in load that a move near 0.6 would cause.

c) Coil valve (cooling capacity):
- At 0.8, but temperatures are not decreasing; still creeping upward. This suggests current cooling is barely matching or slightly under the load.
- We should increase coil to drive temps back toward mid-band.
- Increase coil_valve to 0.9 (not full 1.0 to avoid overshoot and energy spike). This should:
  • Drop supply air temperature somewhat.
  • With slightly higher zone flows and fan speed, improve sensible cooling to all zones.

d) Fan speed (total airflow):
- At 0.75 now. Higher fan speed improves both cooling delivery (more CFM across coil at colder supply air) and CO₂ dilution but increases fan power roughly with cube of speed.
- We already opened Z1 & Z3 dampers a bit; if we kept fan constant, those zones get relatively more flow, which is good. But raising fan slightly will:
  • Support faster CO₂ reduction for all zones.
  • Help combat rising zone temps without needing to max out coil.
- Increase fan_speed moderately from 0.75 to 0.8 to avoid large power penalty (still well below 1.0 and far from 1.4 max).

6) Check bounds and smoothness:
- Action bounds:
  • zone_dampers: [0.05, 1.0] → all chosen values between 0.75–0.96 OK.
  • oa_damper: [0.05, 0.6] → 0.45 OK.
  • coil_valve: [0.06, 1.0] → 0.9 OK.
  • fan_speed: [0.45, 1.4] → 0.8 OK.
- Changes vs previous are incremental to avoid instability:
  • Dampers: ±0.0–0.04.
  • OA: +0.05.
  • Coil: +0.1.
  • Fan: +0.05.

7) Expected near-term outcome (next 5 minutes):
- Temperatures: Increased coil and slightly higher airflow should at least arrest the upward drift; likely small downward movement or stabilization just below/around current values, bringing Z2–Z3 closer to 27 or slightly below, and Z1 closer to ~26.5–26.7.
- CO₂: Slightly more OA and fan will gradually push Z1 down from 1025 and moderate the rise in Z3; both should stay safely under violation threshold and trend closer to the 1000 target over successive intervals.
- Energy: Fan and coil power will increase somewhat, but the trading seems favorable given comfort and CO₂ penalties.

Conclusion: Use slightly increased coil, moderate fan boost, modest OA increase, and slightly more damper opening in the most problematic zones (Z1 and Z3), holding others roughly steady.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.85, 0.96, 0.75], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.9, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.
- Current temps:
  • Zone 1: 26.7°C (inside band, slightly warm).
  • Zone 2: 27.0°C (at warm edge of band).
  • Zone 3: 27.1°C (just outside upper comfort band, too warm).
  • Zone 4: 27.1°C (too warm, similar to Zone 3).
- Temperature trends are flat (0.0 °C/min), so last action roughly holds temps steady.
- Outdoor air is very hot: 35.4°C, trending slightly down but still much hotter than indoor setpoint. Bringing in more OA increases cooling load and may warm supply air if coil is limited.
- CO₂:
  • Zone 1: 1012 ppm (slightly above 1000 target), trending down at -2.2 ppm/min.
  • Zone 2: 968 ppm (below target), -1.7 ppm/min.
  • Zone 3: 989 ppm (just below target), -1.6 ppm/min.
  • Zone 4: 832 ppm (comfortably below target), -1.3 ppm/min.
- Violation threshold is 1100 ppm; all zones are safely below, and CO₂ is already decreasing. So CO₂ risk is low in the next 5 minutes even if we modestly reduce OA.

2) Infer effect of previous action:
Previous setpoints:
- Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.85, 0.96, 0.75] — relatively high, meaning strong airflow everywhere, especially Zones 1 & 3.
- OA damper: 0.45 — fairly high outdoor air fraction given 35.4°C outside.
- Coil valve: 0.90 — near maximum cooling, to fight high outdoor temperature and internal loads.
- Fan speed: 0.80 — moderately high, significant fan power but not extreme.
With these, zone temps stayed warm and flat, indicating either high sensible load or that supply air temp and airflow combination is just enough to maintain ~27°C but not cool further.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
Goals:
- Slightly increase net cooling to bring Zones 2–4 back into band and move closer to 26°C, without overshooting and wasting energy.
- Manage CO₂: slight priority to Zone 1 and Zone 3 for ventilation, but we can likely reduce total OA given trends are downward and concentrations are near/below target.
- Reduce energy if possible: fan, coil, and OA fraction all contribute to power.

Trade-offs:
- Increasing coil_valve and/or fan_speed improves cooling but increases power.
- Increasing OA at 35.4°C adds load; since CO₂ is trending down, we should not increase OA beyond what’s needed to keep CO₂ under control.
- Zone dampers can be rebalanced: reduce flow where conditions are closer to target; increase for the too-warm zones, within the same overall system airflow provided by fan speed.

Given that temperatures are flat with coil 0.9 and fan 0.8, pushing cooling a bit more is necessary to lower temps, but I should do it efficiently:
- Slight bump in coil valve from 0.90 to 0.95: improves cooling capacity with a modest power increase.
- Keep fan speed roughly similar or only nudge it; large increases are costly. I’ll leave fan at 0.80 to avoid extra fan power—the main lever will be coil and damper rebalance.
- OA damper: with Zone 1 just over 1000 ppm and trending down, we can slightly reduce OA for energy savings but not aggressively, to avoid reversing the CO₂ trend. I’ll lower OA from 0.45 to 0.40. This should still provide substantial fresh air and maintain downward CO₂ trends, given short 5-minute horizon.

Zone damper rebalancing:
- Zone 1 (26.7°C, 1012 ppm): slightly warm, slightly high CO₂. Keep high airflow to cool and ventilate but trim a bit because it is inside the comfort band and already has the highest damper.
- Zone 2 (27.0°C, 968 ppm): warm edge of band, lower CO₂. Needs some cooling but not as much as Zone 3 & 4.
- Zone 3 (27.1°C, 989 ppm): just out of band, slightly high temp and near-1000 ppm. Prioritise this zone for airflow.
- Zone 4 (27.1°C, 832 ppm): same temp as Zone 3 but much lower CO₂. Focus mainly on cooling; less need for ventilation-driven airflow.

We don’t know if zone dampers directly compete for total system flow, but assuming total flow scales primarily with fan speed and coil, we can still bias distribution:
- Decrease Zone 1 damper slightly from 0.95 to 0.90.
- Increase Zone 2 very slightly from 0.85 to 0.88 to help reduce temp without a big change.
- Keep Zone 3 very high as top cooling priority: from 0.96 to 0.98.
- Increase Zone 4 moderately from 0.75 to 0.80 to help bring it back into band.

These are small to moderate adjustments that aim to:
- Increase cooling capacity (coil 0.95) while not increasing fan power.
- Modestly reduce OA to save energy while keeping CO₂ safe given downward trends.
- Focus more airflow on the warmest zones (3 & 4), maintain good flow in Zone 1 for CO₂, and moderate flow in Zone 2.

4) Check bounds and clip:
- zone_dampers bounds: [0.05, 1.0]
  • Z1: 0.90 → within [0.05, 1.0]
  • Z2: 0.88 → within
  • Z3: 0.98 → within
  • Z4: 0.80 → within
- oa_damper bounds: [0.05, 0.6] → 0.40 is within.
- coil_valve bounds: [0.06, 1.0] → 0.95 is within.
- fan_speed bounds: [0.45, 1.4] → 0.80 is within.

5) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Slightly colder supply air due to higher coil_valve with similar fan speed should begin to pull all zones downward in temperature, especially 3 and 4 due to higher dampers.
- CO₂ should continue to drift downward or at least remain near current values, staying below 1100 ppm, despite a minor OA reduction.
- Energy use increases slightly from more coil but is offset partly by reduced OA and stable fan speed, likely improving overall reward due to better comfort and maintained CO₂ control.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.88, 0.98, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.95, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.
- All zones are warm-biased and near/above upper band:
  - Z1: 26.8°C (within band but close to hot edge), dT/dt ≈ 0.
  - Z2: 27.0°C (upper band edge), dT/dt ≈ 0.
  - Z3: 27.1°C (slightly outside band, too warm), dT/dt ≈ 0.
  - Z4: 27.0°C, dT/dt ≈ -0.01°C/min (slight cooling trend).
- CO2 status (target <1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm):
  - Z1: 1015 ppm, rising 0.4 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ 1017 ppm (above target but far below violation).
  - Z2: 968 ppm, stable.
  - Z3: 989 ppm, stable.
  - Z4: 831 ppm, decreasing.
- Outdoor air is hot: 35.1°C (well above indoor), so extra OA significantly raises cooling load.
- Previous actions: strong cooling/high flow: zone dampers ~0.8–0.98, OA = 0.4, coil = 0.95, fan = 0.8.

We need more cooling (since temps are high and not yet trending down) but must balance against energy and avoid unnecessary OA because outside is very hot.

2) CO2 vs OA damper trade-off:
- Only Z1 is modestly above CO2 target; others are at or below 1000 ppm.
- No zone is close to 1100 ppm; in 5 minutes Z1 will stay ~1015–1020 ppm even with similar ventilation.
- Therefore, we do NOT need to increase OA fraction aggressively for CO2; we might even reduce OA slightly to cut cooling load, as long as CO2 doesn’t start climbing too fast.
- With fan at moderate-high speed and OA damper not too low, mixing should still keep CO2 under violation threshold comfortably.

Given high outdoor temperature, the optimal strategy is:
- Keep OA at a modest level sufficient for ventilation but lower than previous 0.4 to reduce hot air intake.

3) Cooling capacity vs fan/dampers:
- All zones are at or above 27°C except Z1 (26.8°C). Cooling is needed across the board; no obviously over-cooled zone to throttle.
- Coil valve was 0.95 (near max) with essentially flat temperatures, indicating that at the previous flow rates, we were just barely holding or not yet pulling temperatures down.
- We should maintain strong cooling coil command (near max) for at least this interval to start driving temps downward toward the 26°C center.

4) Fan speed decision:
- Fan was 0.8. With hot OA, more airflow increases both sensible load from OA and cooling delivery to zones from coil.
- Since we plan to reduce OA fraction, increasing fan slightly can increase delivery of cold air to zones without too much extra OA penalty.
- However, fan energy is penalized via power_weight; we don’t want to go to extremes unless needed.
- Temperatures are only about 1°C above the setpoint and nearly steady; modestly boosting fan above 0.8 should help distribute cooling better to zones without huge energy cost.
- A reasonable choice is around 0.9: more airflow than before, but far from maximum (1.4).

5) Zone damper decisions:
- All zones are warm; none should be starved of air.
- Z3 is slightly hottest (27.1°C) and needs a bit of priority.
- Z1 is within band but also near upper edge and has highest CO2; giving it good airflow helps both cooling and CO2 dilution.
- Z4 is cooling slightly already and has low CO2; it can be slightly deprioritised to save some airflow or reallocate cooling to the warmer zones.
- However, completely closing any zone is not advisable; we want reasonably high flows everywhere given general warmth.

Concrete adjustments from previous:
- Previous dampers: [0.9, 0.88, 0.98, 0.8].
- Adjustments:
  - Zone 1: keep high, maybe slight increase to ensure CO2 and temp control → ~0.95.
  - Zone 2: keep similar or small bump since at 27.0°C → ~0.9.
  - Zone 3: hottest, keep very open near max → 1.0 (max allowed).
  - Zone 4: can be slightly reduced to shift capacity to others but still high because still warm → ~0.75.

6) OA damper decision:
- Bounds: [0.05, 0.6]. Current: 0.4.
- Given outdoor 35.1°C and CO2 only slightly above target in one zone, we should reduce OA to lower heat gain but not so low that CO2 rises quickly.
- A moderate value around 0.25–0.3 keeps significant ventilation while cutting OA load relative to 0.4.
- Choose 0.3 as a balanced compromise for this 5-min window.

7) Coil valve decision:
- Bounds: [0.06, 1.0]. Current: 0.95.
- Temperatures have been flat; we haven’t yet created a cooling-down trend. To start bringing temps toward 26°C, maintain full or near-full cooling.
- Set coil_valve = 1.0 to maximise cooling while OA fraction is reduced.

8) Fan speed decision (revisited with above choices):
- With coil at 1.0 and OA at 0.3, we can use airside distribution to drive temps down.
- Fan was 0.8. Increase slightly to 0.9 to improve cold air delivery, accepting some energy cost because comfort errors are fairly large (about +1°C) and currently static.
- 0.9 stays well within [0.45, 1.4] and is a modest increase.

9) Safety / bounds check:
- zone_dampers: [0.95, 0.9, 1.0, 0.75] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.3 within [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve: 1.0 within [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.9 within [0.45, 1.4].

10) Expected outcome next 5 minutes:
- Strong coil and slightly higher fan with high zone damper openings should start driving all zones’ temperatures downward, especially Z2 and Z3.
- Reduced OA will temper chiller load while still providing enough ventilation to keep CO2 below violation threshold, though Z1 may remain slightly above the 1000 ppm target; this is acceptable relative to energy and thermal comfort trade-offs.

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Objectives and current state:\n- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.\n- All zones are warm-biased and near/above upper band:\n  - Z1: 26.8°C (within band but close to hot edge), dT/dt ≈ 0.\n  - Z2: 27.0°C (upper band edge), dT/dt ≈ 0.\n  - Z3: 27.1°C (slightly outside band, too warm), dT/dt ≈ 0.\n  - Z4: 27.0°C, dT/dt ≈ -0.01°C/min (slight cooling trend).\n- CO2 status (target <1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm):\n  - Z1: 1015 ppm, rising 0.4 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ 1017 ppm (above target but far below violation).\n  - Z2: 968 ppm, stable.\n  - Z3: 989 ppm, stable.\n  - Z4: 831 ppm, decreasing.\n- Outdoor air is hot: 35.1°C (well above indoor), so extra OA significantly raises cooling load.\n- Previous actions: strong cooling/high flow: zone dampers ~0.8–0.98, OA = 0.4, coil = 0.95, fan = 0.8.\n\nWe need more cooling (since temps are high and not yet trending down) but must balance against energy and avoid unnecessary OA because outside is very hot.\n\n2) CO2 vs OA damper trade-off:\n- Only Z1 is modestly above CO2 target; others are at or below 1000 ppm.\n- No zone is close to 1100 ppm; in 5 minutes Z1 will stay ~1015–1020 ppm even with similar ventilation.\n- Therefore, we do NOT need to increase OA fraction aggressively for CO2; we might even reduce OA slightly to cut cooling load, as long as CO2 doesn’t start climbing too fast.\n- With fan at moderate-high speed and OA damper not too low, mixing should still keep CO2 under violation threshold comfortably.\n\nGiven high outdoor temperature, the optimal strategy is:\n- Keep OA at a modest level sufficient for ventilation but lower than previous 0.4 to reduce hot air intake.\n\n3) Cooling capacity vs fan/dampers:\n- All zones are at or above 27°C except Z1 (26.8°C). Cooling is needed across the board; no obviously over-cooled zone to throttle.\n- Coil valve was 0.95 (near max) with essentially flat temperatures, indicating that at the previous flow rates, we were just barely holding or not yet pulling temperatures down.\n- We should maintain strong cooling coil command (near max) for at least this interval to start driving temps downward toward the 26°C center.\n\n4) Fan speed decision:\n- Fan was 0.8. With hot OA, more airflow increases both sensible load from OA and cooling delivery to zones from coil.\n- Since we plan to reduce OA fraction, increasing fan slightly can increase delivery of cold air to zones without too much extra OA penalty.\n- However, fan energy is penalized via power_weight; we don’t want to go to extremes unless needed.\n- Temperatures are only about 1°C above the setpoint and nearly steady; modestly boosting fan above 0.8 should help distribute cooling better to zones without huge energy cost.\n- A reasonable choice is around 0.9: more airflow than before, but far from maximum (1.4).\n\n5) Zone damper decisions:\n- All zones are warm; none should be starved of air.\n- Z3 is slightly hottest (27.1°C) and needs a bit of priority.\n- Z1 is within band but also near upper edge and has highest CO2; giving it good airflow helps both cooling and CO2 dilution.\n- Z4 is cooling slightly already and has low CO2; it can be slightly deprioritised to save some airflow or reallocate cooling to the warmer zones.\n- However, completely closing any zone is not advisable; we want reasonably high flows everywhere given general warmth.\n\nConcrete adjustments from previous:\n- Previous dampers: [0.9, 0.88, 0.98, 0.8].\n- Adjustments:\n  - Zone 1: keep high, maybe slight increase to ensure CO2 and temp control → ~0.95.\n  - Zone 2: keep similar or small bump since at 27.0°C → ~0.9.\n  - Zone 3: hottest, keep very open near max → 1.0 (max allowed).\n  - Zone 4: can be slightly reduced to shift capacity to others but still high because still warm → ~0.75.\n\n6) OA damper decision:\n- Bounds: [0.05, 0.6]. Current: 0.4.\n- Given outdoor 35.1°C and CO2 only slightly above target in one zone, we should reduce OA to lower heat gain but not so low that CO2 rises quickly.\n- A moderate value around 0.25–0.3 keeps significant ventilation while cutting OA load relative to 0.4.\n- Choose 0.3 as a balanced compromise for this 5-min window.\n\n7) Coil valve decision:\n- Bounds: [0.06, 1.0]. Current: 0.95.\n- Temperatures have been flat; we haven’t yet created a cooling-down trend. To start bringing temps toward 26°C, maintain full or near-full cooling.\n- Set coil_valve = 1.0 to maximise cooling while OA fraction is reduced.\n\n8) Fan speed decision (revisited with above choices):\n- With coil at 1.0 and OA at 0.3, we can use airside distribution to drive temps down.\n- Fan was 0.8. Increase slightly to 0.9 to improve cold air delivery, accepting some energy cost because comfort errors are fairly large (about +1°C) and currently static.\n- 0.9 stays well within [0.45, 1.4] and is a modest increase.\n\n9) Safety / bounds check:\n- zone_dampers: [0.95, 0.9, 1.0, 0.75] all within [0.05, 1.0].\n- oa_damper: 0.3 within [0.05, 0.6].\n- coil_valve: 1.0 within [0.06, 1.0].\n- fan_speed: 0.9 within [0.45, 1.4].\n\n10) Expected outcome next 5 minutes:\n- Strong coil and slightly higher fan with high zone damper openings should start driving all zones’ temperatures downward, especially Z2 and Z3.\n- Reduced OA will temper chiller load while still providing enough ventilation to keep CO2 below violation threshold, though Z1 may remain slightly above the 1000 ppm target; this is acceptable relative to energy and thermal comfort trade-offs.\n\nThis set of actions aims to improve comfort (pull temps toward 26°C), avoid CO2 violations, and modestly reduce OA-driven cooling load compared to the previous step, thus improving the overall reward."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- All zones are slightly too warm vs 26°C setpoint and just within/at the upper comfort band:
  - Z1: 26.7°C (error +0.7, trending down slightly), CO2 1024 ppm and slowly rising → already above 1000 target and drifting up.
  - Z2: 26.9°C (error +0.9), CO2 977 ppm and rising.
  - Z3: 27.1°C (error +1.1, just outside 27°C band), CO2 997 ppm and rising.
  - Z4: 27.0°C (error +1.0), CO2 845 ppm and rising.
- Outdoor: 35.2°C, very hot, so more OA increases cooling load significantly.
- Previous actions: high cooling and airflow:
  - Zone dampers: [0.95, 0.9, 1.0, 0.75]
  - OA damper: 0.3
  - Coil valve: 1.0 (max cooling)
  - Fan speed: 0.9

2) Objectives vs current trends:
- Thermal comfort: we need to bring zones toward 26°C. Temps are slightly decreasing (−0.01°C/min), but that trend is under strong cooling already. Given outdoor is very hot, backing off cooling too much now risks drifting further above 27°C, especially for Zones 3–4 that are around/above the band edge. So maintain strong coil and fan at least this interval.
- CO2: Z1 is already above 1000 ppm and rising; Z2 & Z3 are just below/around target and rising; Z4 still below but rising fastest. Risk: crossing 1100 ppm triggers violation penalty. To avoid that, we should modestly increase OA and ensure enough airflow to dilute CO2. However, OA is costly for cooling because OA temp is 35.2°C.
- Energy: we’re currently at very high cooling power. But comfort and CO2 penalties can be large (especially violation penalty = 10). Short term, avoiding comfort and CO2 penalties likely outweighs a small energy saving. So slight bias toward comfort/IAQ over energy this 5-min interval.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Coil valve: keep at or near 1.0 because:
  - Zone 3 is above comfort band (27.1°C) and others are at upper edge.
  - OA is very hot, and we’re considering increasing OA slightly for CO2.
  - Next 5 minutes we want to pull temperatures back solidly within band; overcooling risk is low now because current trend is only mildly downward even at full coil.
  → Action: keep coil_valve = 1.0.

- Fan speed:
  - Higher fan helps cooling delivery to zones and improves CO2 dilution, but increases power.
  - With one zone above band and CO2 trending upward across zones, it’s safer to slightly increase fan from 0.9 to improve both comfort and CO2, accepting some energy cost.
  - No clear reason to go to extreme (1.2–1.4) because that would spike power. A modest bump to 1.0 is a good compromise: better mixing and CO2 control with limited extra energy.
  → Set fan_speed = 1.0.

- Outdoor air damper:
  - Currently 0.3; bounds [0.05, 0.6].
  - Z1 CO2 is already above the 1000 target, and all trends are upward. If we leave OA at 0.3, CO2 will likely continue rising; the violation threshold is 1100 ppm, giving a large penalty if crossed.
  - Increasing OA improves CO2 but worsens cooling energy because OA is at 35.2°C.
  - We already have max coil and slightly higher fan. A moderate OA increase from 0.3 to about 0.4 balances IAQ improvement and energy/cooling load. Jumping to 0.6 might be excessive given short interval and would unnecessarily raise cooling power.
  → Set oa_damper = 0.4.

- Zone dampers:
  - All zones need cooling; none are below setpoint. So no need to restrict dampers significantly.
  - Priority: Zone 3 is hottest and near-violation of comfort band; Zone 4 also at 27.0°C and fastest CO2 increase.
  - We already have high positions: [0.95, 0.9, 1.0, 0.75]. Given comfort and CO2 situation, it’s reasonable to keep them high, maybe bias more to Z3 and Z4 and slightly trim where possible to reduce unneeded airflow.
  - However, Z1’s CO2 is highest and above target; reducing its damper would hurt CO2 dilution there. So maintain high damper for Z1.
  - Z2 is slightly cooler than Z3 and has CO2 just under target; a very small reduction there to save a bit of airflow is possible but should be minimal.

  Specific adjustments:
  - Zone 1: keep near current 0.95 → stay at 0.95 (needs both cooling and CO2 dilution).
  - Zone 2: slightly reduce from 0.9 to 0.85 to marginally save airflow while still high enough for comfort/CO2.
  - Zone 3: keep at 1.0 (hottest zone, high CO2).
  - Zone 4: raise from 0.75 to 0.8: it’s at upper band, fastest CO2 increase; a bit more air helps cooling & dilution.

- Bounds check:
  - zone_dampers all within [0.05, 1.0].
  - oa_damper = 0.4 within [0.05, 0.6].
  - coil_valve = 1.0 within [0.06, 1.0].
  - fan_speed = 1.0 within [0.45, 1.4].

4) Expected outcome for this interval:
- Temperatures should trend further down toward 26°C or at least decisively into 25–27°C band, reducing comfort penalties, especially for Zone 3.
- CO2 levels, especially in Z1 and Z3, should grow more slowly or begin to stabilize due to higher OA and slightly higher fan, reducing risk of crossing 1100 ppm.
- Energy use remains high but controlled; any potential energy savings are deferred until zones are safely centered in comfort band and CO2 is trending down or flat.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.85, 1.0, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 1.0}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current conditions:
- All zones are slightly above the 26°C comfort center but within the 25–27°C comfort band:
  - Z1: 26.6°C (error +0.6, cooling very slowly, -0.01°C/min)
  - Z2: 26.8°C (error +0.8, -0.01°C/min)
  - Z3: 27.0°C (error +1.0, -0.01°C/min)

- Trend suggests very slow cooling despite max coil (1.0) and high fan (1.0) and mostly wide-open dampers. Outdoor temp is hot (35.2°C and rising slightly), so economizer cooling is not available; outdoor air is a heat load.
- CO2:

  - Z2: 961 ppm, trending down → ~945 ppm

  All zones are below 1000 ppm or at target and improving; far from the 1100 ppm violation threshold.

2) Reward trade-offs:
- Comfort: Slightly warm but drifting down slowly. We want to cool a bit more to pull zones toward 26°C without overshooting or using excessive power.
- CO2: Adequate ventilation already; CO2 is decreasing everywhere. We can modestly reduce OA fraction and total airflow to cut energy while staying under 1000 ppm.
- Power: Biggest levers for power are fan_speed and coil_valve (which drives chiller/pump energy). With zones still warm, we should keep coil nearly maxed but can consider reducing fan slightly and optimizing damper distribution.

3) Infer system behavior from trends and previous action:
- Previous action:
  - zone_dampers: [0.95, 0.85, 1.0, 0.8]
  - oa_damper: 0.4
  - coil_valve: 1.0
  - fan_speed: 1.0
- Despite strong cooling (max coil and high fan), zone cooling rate is only about 0.05°C over 5 minutes. That suggests:
  - We may be near capacity against a heavy load (hot outdoor, internal loads); further coil opening offers no gain (already at 1.0).
  - Zone 3 is the warmest (27.0°C), then Zone 4 (26.9), Zone 2 (26.8), Zone 1 (26.6). Zone 3 damper already at 1.0; others quite open.

4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Temperature objective: Encourage more cooling in the warmest zones (3 and 4) while not overcooling the cooler ones. Maintain high cooling capacity but use zoning to prioritize warm zones.
- CO2 objective: Since all zones are below or at target and falling, we can slightly reduce OA fraction and total air to save energy as long as CO2 remains comfortably below 1000 ppm.
- Energy objective: Slightly reduce fan speed (quadratic power savings) and OA damper while keeping enough airflow to ensure cooling. Coil remains at 1.0 because we are not yet cool enough, and backing off coil would further slow the already modest cooling rate.

5) Quantitative reasoning for actuator adjustments:
- Coil valve:
  - Zones are above setpoint and barely cooling; we should keep coil at 1.0 for this interval to try to pull temperatures closer to 26°C.
  - Set coil_valve = 1.0 (upper bound 1.0, clipped: 1.0).

- Fan speed:
  - At 1.0 previously. Reducing too much risks slowing cooling further. However, a small reduction (e.g., to 0.9) will reduce power meaningfully while still providing strong airflow.
  - Expected effect: Slightly lower sensible cooling delivered if coil capacity is air-flow limited, but with maximum coil and still-warm zones, a small step from 1.0 → 0.9 is a reasonable power vs. comfort trade.
  - Choose fan_speed = 0.9 (within [0.45, 1.4]).

- OA damper:
  - Currently 0.4 with outdoor 35.2°C, much warmer than indoor (~27°C). More OA increases both cooling load and CO2 improvement. But CO2 is already at or below target and decreasing.
  - We can reduce OA a bit to cut load while still ventilating enough to keep CO2 below 1000 ppm. A modest change avoids any sudden CO2 rebound.
  - Choose oa_damper = 0.3 (within [0.05, 0.6]) as a moderate step down from 0.4.

- Zone dampers (relative distribution):
  - Goal: Favor warmer zones (3 and 4), slightly restrict the cooler zone (1), and modestly restrict zone 2.
  - Current: [0.95, 0.85, 1.0, 0.8]. Warmth ranking: Z3 > Z4 > Z2 > Z1.
  - Zone 3: keep at 1.0 (max) to continue prioritizing this warmest zone.
  - Zone 4: slightly increase from 0.8 to 0.9 to push more cool air there.
  - Zone 2: leave unchanged at 0.85 (slightly warm but not worst; already relatively open).
  - Zone 1: cooler and at CO2=1000 trending downward; we can reduce slightly to favor others and save some energy. Decrease from 0.95 to 0.9.
  - New distribution: [0.9, 0.85, 1.0, 0.9], all within [0.05, 1.0]. This maintains high overall airflow bias toward the warmest zones while slightly trimming the coolest one.

6) Check comfort and CO2 implications:
- With coil=1.0 and fan=0.9 (slightly less airflow), the net cooling per zone may be similar or slightly reduced relative to last interval, but more air is directed to Zones 3 and 4. Likely zone temps will decrease another ~0.04–0.06°C over 5 minutes, keeping all zones within comfort band and nudging them toward 26°C.
- CO2 with reduced OA (0.3 vs 0.4) and slightly lower fan could reduce the downward slope of CO2 slightly, but current trends are strong and values are comfortably below or at target. It is unlikely any zone will approach 1000+ in the next 5 minutes; Z1 will actually move below 1000 even with slightly reduced ventilation.

7) Final chosen setpoints (clipped to bounds):
- zone_dampers: [0.9, 0.85, 1.0, 0.9]
- oa_damper: 0.3
- coil_valve: 1.0
- fan_speed: 0.9
These settings maintain strong cooling focused on the warmest zones, maintain acceptable ventilation, and reduce energy somewhat vs. the previous high-power configuration, improving the overall reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.85, 1.0, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.9}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Comfort target: 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize fan/chiller power while staying in band and under CO2 limit.

All zones are within the 25–27°C band but slightly warm:
- Z1: 26.5°C, cooling slowly (−0.02°C/min), CO2 991 ppm, trending down.
- Z2: 26.7°C, cooling slowly, CO2 954 ppm, trending down.
- Z3: 26.9°C, cooling very slowly (−0.01°C/min), CO2 982 ppm, trending up (+0.4 ppm/min).
- Z4: 26.7°C, cooling a bit faster, CO2 836 ppm, slight upward trend.

In 5 minutes, approximate projected temps:
- Z1: 26.5 + 5*(−0.02) ≈ 26.4°C.
- Z2: 26.7 + 5*(−0.02) ≈ 26.6°C.
- Z3: 26.9 + 5*(−0.01) ≈ 26.85°C.
- Z4: 26.7 + 5*(−0.03) ≈ 26.55°C.
All remain within comfort band, slightly above 26°C but acceptable.

Projected CO2 in 5 minutes:
- Z1: 991 + 5*(−1.6) ≈ 983 ppm.
- Z2: 954 + 5*(−1.3) ≈ 948 ppm.
- Z3: 982 + 5*(+0.4) ≈ 984 ppm.
- Z4: 836 + 5*(+0.3) ≈ 838 ppm.
All remain under 1000 ppm and far below the 1100 ppm violation threshold.

Outdoor air is very hot (35.4°C, rising), so extra OA or airflow will increase cooling load. Given we are within temperature and CO2 constraints with improving or acceptable trends, we can begin reducing energy use while guarding Z3 (warmest and CO2-riskiest).

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Coil valve: Currently at 1.0 (max cooling). Zone temps are trending down and are within band; we can reduce coil to lower chiller/pump power while staying safe. However, outdoor is very hot, mid-day, so we shouldn’t drop too aggressively. A moderate reduction to ~0.8 should still maintain or gently cool, given high airflow.
- Fan speed: Currently 0.9. CO2 is near but below target; all trends are safe. Fan power is expensive; we can slightly reduce to ~0.8 to save fan energy and still provide good ventilation and cooling distribution.
- OA damper: Currently 0.3 (30%), with CO2 around target but not critical. Increasing OA would raise cooling load because OA is very hot. CO2 is acceptable and will likely stay under 1000 ppm, so we can slightly reduce OA to around 0.25 to reduce load while keeping adequate fresh air.
- Zone dampers: Previously high (0.9, 0.85, 1.0, 0.9). We want to maintain more airflow to warmer / higher-CO2 zone (Zone 3) and can trim slightly in others to lower total flow and thus fan energy, without causing discomfort. Reduce all slightly but keep Zone 3 highest:
  - Z3: from 1.0 to 0.95 (remain highest to address warmest temp and rising CO2).
  - Z1: from 0.9 to 0.85.
  - Z2: from 0.85 to 0.8.
  - Z4: from 0.9 to 0.85.

This should:
- Keep temperatures within band, likely still slightly above 26°C but acceptable.
- Keep CO2 safely below 1000 ppm and far from 1100 ppm.
- Reduce coil and fan power modestly, improving reward from energy terms without incurring comfort or CO2 penalties.

3) Bounds check:
- zone_dampers must be [0.05, 1.0]: chosen values 0.85, 0.8, 0.95, 0.85 all within bounds.
- oa_damper [0.05, 0.6]: chosen 0.25 within bounds.
- coil_valve [0.06, 1.0]: chosen 0.8 within bounds.
- fan_speed [0.45, 1.4]: chosen 0.8 within bounds.

These setpoints are clipped-compliant and should improve the reward over the next 5 minutes by saving energy while maintaining comfort and CO2 constraints.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.8, 0.95, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.25, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- All zones are slightly above setpoint but within band:
  • Z1: 26.5°C (error +0.5, cooling very slowly: -0.01°C/min)
  • Z2: 26.7°C (error +0.7, -0.01°C/min)
  • Z3: 26.9°C (error +0.9, ~0 trend)
  • Z4: 26.7°C (error +0.7, -0.02°C/min)
- Temperatures are not dropping fast enough; with outdoor at 35.6°C and rising, heat gains will remain strong.

CO2 status vs objectives:
- Target <1000 ppm, violation threshold 1100 ppm.
  • Z1: 1001 ppm, rising +2.1 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ 1011 ppm.
  • Z2: 962 ppm, +1.6 ppm/min → ≈ 970 ppm.
  • Z3: 997 ppm, +2.8 ppm/min → ≈ 1011 ppm.
  • Z4: 847 ppm, +2.1 ppm/min → ≈ 858 ppm.
- Z1 already slightly above target; Z3 about to cross; none near violation threshold yet, but upward trends indicate insufficient ventilation.

Energy context:
- Previous actuators: zone dampers fairly high, coil 0.8, fan 0.8, OA 0.25.
- Outdoor is much hotter than indoor, so increasing OA greatly raises cooling load; must balance CO2 penalties vs power use.

2) Strategy to maximise reward for next 5 min:
- Thermal: Slightly increase overall cooling capacity to pull all zones toward 26°C while staying within 25–27°C band. Avoid big jumps to limit energy use, but present trends show that without extra cooling, some zones (esp. Z3) may edge toward upper band.
  • Increase coil_valve modestly above 0.8.
  • Keep fan near current level or slightly increase to improve distribution; too much increase raises fan power more than needed.
- Ventilation/CO2: Z1 and Z3 are near/over 1000 ppm and rising; Z2 and Z4 are okay. To address CO2:
  • Slightly increase OA damper to improve fresh air without a big thermal penalty.
  • Keep zone dampers relatively open to maintain ventilation to high-CO2 zones; possibly reduce slightly in lower-CO2 or less-critical zones to save fan/coil energy, but avoid big changes to maintain mixing.

3) Zone-level reasoning:
- Z3 is warmest (26.9°C) and near 1000 ppm: needs strong cooling and ventilation.
- Z1: slightly cooler than Z3 but already above CO2 target; maintain high flow.
- Z2: moderately warm, CO2 under target; can be slightly less open.
- Z4: moderate temp, low CO2; can be slightly reduced to save energy while still maintaining comfort.

4) Concrete actuator decisions (then clip to bounds):
Bounds:
- zone_dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
- oa_damper: [0.05, 0.6]
- coil_valve: [0.06, 1.0]
- fan_speed: [0.45, 1.4]

Starting from previous_action:
- zone_dampers: [0.85, 0.8, 0.95, 0.85]
  • Z1: Keep high to manage both temp and CO2 → 0.85.
  • Z2: Slight reduction to trim flow and save energy, still high → 0.75.
  • Z3: Slightly increase to maximize flow where it’s most needed → 0.98 (near max but within 1.0).
  • Z4: Slight reduction; this zone is relatively better on CO2 and cooling trend → 0.8.

- oa_damper: from 0.25 → modest increase to improve CO2 but avoid excessive hot intake. A step to ~0.3 is a reasonable compromise → 0.3 (well within [0.05, 0.6]).

- coil_valve: from 0.8 → increase slightly to boost cooling capacity, anticipating high outdoor heat and slow current cooling rates. Choose 0.85 (within [0.06, 1.0]); enough to improve comfort but not maxed out.

- fan_speed: from 0.8 → small increase to enhance both zone and OA airflow, helping CO2 and cooling distribution, but avoid big power hit. Set to 0.85 (within [0.45, 1.4]).

5) Expected near-term effects (5 minutes):
- Temperatures: Additional coil and slight fan increase should accelerate cooling; Z3 should start trending downward instead of flat; other zones should move closer to 26°C and remain within 25–27°C.
- CO2: Higher OA and maintaining high dampers for Z1/Z3 should slow or reverse CO2 rise, keeping ppm away from violation threshold and moving closer to target.
- Energy: Slight increases in coil and fan raise power, but these are moderate increases aimed at preventing future comfort/CO2 penalties, improving overall reward.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort & temperature assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27 °C with ideal at 26 °C.
- Current zone temps:
  • Zone 1: 26.4 °C (0.4 above setpoint, slightly warm, trending down at -0.01 °C/min → about -0.05 °C over 5 min → projected ~26.35 °C)
  • Zone 2: 26.6 °C (0.6 high, trending down to ~26.55 °C)
  • Zone 3: 26.9 °C (0.9 high, trending down to ~26.85 °C; warmest zone, closest to 27 °C limit)
  • Zone 4: 26.6 °C (0.6 high, faster cooling at -0.02 °C/min → ~26.5 °C)
- All zones are within the 25–27 °C band but on the warm side. With hot outdoor air (35.6 °C), we should maintain adequate cooling. However, current coil_valve and fan are already high (0.85 each), so we can try a slight reduction while making sure Zone 3 does not drift above 27 °C.

2) CO2 assessment:
- Targets: keep below 1000 ppm (hard violation at 1100 ppm).
- Zone CO2 and trends:
  • Zone 1: 997 ppm, slightly decreasing (-0.8 ppm/min → about -4 ppm) → projected ~993 ppm (just under target, moving safer).
  • Zone 2: 961 ppm, essentially flat.
  • Zone 3: 998 ppm, slightly increasing (0.1 ppm/min → +0.5 ppm) → projected ~998.5 ppm, still under 1000 but with small upward drift.
  • Zone 4: 848 ppm, rising (0.2 ppm/min → +1 ppm) to ~849 ppm.
- The limiting zones are 1 and 3 near 1000 ppm but not crossing, and Zone 1 is actually improving. We should avoid reducing total ventilation too aggressively; some fresh air is still needed.

3) Energy considerations:
- Reward penalizes power via power_weight = 0.2, so reducing fan_speed and coil_valve saves energy.
- Current global actions: zone_dampers fairly open (0.75–0.98), oa_damper 0.3, coil_valve 0.85, fan_speed 0.85.
- Because all temps are inside the comfort band and trending down slightly, we have some room to reduce cooling power modestly while monitoring Zone 3 closely.

4) Strategy for the next 5 minutes:
- Cooling capacity (coil & fan): slightly reduce both to cut energy but keep enough capacity to avoid Zone 3 exceeding 27 °C.
- Airflow distribution (zone dampers): prioritize the warmest/highest-CO2 zone (Zone 3) by keeping its damper high, and slightly trim where we have more margin (Zones 2 & 4). Zone 1 is near CO2 target and slightly warm; keep it fairly open but not max.
- Outdoor air damper: maintain around current level or slightly adjust. CO2 is close to but under target in worst zones; outdoor temperature is very high, so more OA is expensive. Keep OA around 0.30 to preserve ventilation without extra heat load.

5) Concrete adjustments:
- Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):
  • Zone 3 currently at 0.98; keep essentially max to support cooling and CO2 → set to 0.98.
  • Zone 1 currently at 0.85; keep high for slight temp and CO2 relief but no increase → 0.85.
  • Zone 2 at 0.75; it’s moderately warm but not worst, and CO2 is fine; trim slightly to reduce flow/energy while still comfortable → 0.70.
  • Zone 4 at 0.80; temperature trending down faster and CO2 is low; we can trim a bit more to favor other zones and reduce total flow → 0.70.
- OA damper (0.05–0.6): keep at 0.30. This maintains current ventilation that already yields near-target CO2, avoiding extra heat from more OA.
- Coil valve (0.06–1.0): reduce moderately from 0.85 to 0.80 to save chiller energy while zones are only mildly above setpoint and cooling trend is already downward.
- Fan speed (0.45–1.4): reduce slightly from 0.85 to 0.80 to cut fan energy, but not more to avoid harming temperature and CO2 in Zone 3.

6) Check against constraints:
- All proposed values are within the specified bounds; no clipping is needed.
- This action should:
  • Maintain temperatures within comfort band, likely still decreasing slightly.
  • Keep CO2 in Zones 1 & 3 near but below 1000 ppm, with sufficient OA and airflow.
  • Reduce both fan and coil energy modestly relative to previous step, improving the energy term in the reward while avoiding comfort/CO2 penalties.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.7, 0.98, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- All zones are within band but slightly warm:
  • Z1: 26.4°C, cooling slowly (−0.01°C/min).
  • Z2: 26.6°C, flat trend.
  • Z3: 26.8°C, cooling very slowly.
  • Z4: 26.5°C, flat trend.
- CO2 objective: keep < 1000 ppm, avoid > 1100 ppm.
  • Z1: 996 ppm, slightly decreasing.
  • Z2: 966 ppm, rising at +0.8 ppm/min.
  • Z3: 1000 ppm, rising at +0.4 ppm/min (right at target, risk of exceeding soon).
  • Z4: 853 ppm, rising +0.9 ppm/min.
- Outdoor air: 35.6°C (much hotter than zones), so extra OA costs cooling energy.
- Previous actions: zone dampers [0.85, 0.70, 0.98, 0.70], OA 0.30, coil 0.80, fan 0.80.

2) Trade-offs:
- Comfort: temperatures are OK but drifting slightly warm; with very hot outside air, cooling load is dominated by coil, not by small damper tweaks.
- CO2: Z3 is at 1000 ppm and rising; Z2 and Z4 trending up; Z1 safe and trending down. Need some ventilation emphasis without excessive energy.
- Energy: coil at 0.8 and fan at 0.8 give strong cooling and airflow; might reduce slightly if we can hold temps/CO2.
- OA damper: increasing OA improves CO2 but adds load due to 35.6°C intake air.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Maintain or slightly enhance ventilation where CO2 is high/rising (Z2, Z3, Z4) via zone damper distribution and modest OA.
- Slightly reduce energy (coil and/or fan) but cautiously, since outdoor air is very hot and zones are a bit above 26°C.
- Avoid CO2 violation > 1100 ppm; current trends over 5 minutes:
  • Z3: 1000 + 0.4*5 ≈ 1002 ppm (still near target).
  • Z2: 966 + 0.8*5 ≈ 1006 ppm (slightly above target but well below violation).
  • Z4: 853 + 0.9*5 ≈ 898 ppm.
  • Z1: 996 − 0.1*5 ≈ 996 − 0.5 ≈ 995.5 ppm.
- This suggests we do not need a big OA increase; a small bump plus redistribution should be enough.

4) Zone damper adjustments (bounds 0.05–1.0):
- Z3: hottest (26.8°C) and at highest CO2 (1000 ppm, rising). Keep damper high to prioritize cooling and ventilation. It’s already 0.98; keep at 0.98 (near max) to avoid overreaction.
- Z2: warm (26.6°C) with rising CO2 (966 ppm, +0.8). Slightly increase damper from 0.70 to 0.75 to improve ventilation and cooling.
- Z4: moderate temp (26.5°C) but CO2 rising quickly from a low base; keep reasonable ventilation. 0.70 is fine; maintain 0.70.
- Z1: 26.4°C and CO2 nearly at 1000 ppm but decreasing; this zone can afford slightly less airflow to free capacity/energy and allow better distribution to Z2/Z3. Reduce damper from 0.85 to 0.80, a mild change.
- Resulting zone dampers: [0.80, 0.75, 0.98, 0.70]. All within [0.05, 1.0].

5) Outdoor air damper (bounds 0.05–0.6):
- Currently 0.30. Hot OA (35.6°C) makes increased OA expensive.
- CO2 is mostly near but below target and not threatening violation; modest extra OA is enough preventative action.
- Slight increase from 0.30 to 0.35 to give a bit more fresh air to all zones and slow CO2 rise, without a big energy penalty.
- Clip check: 0.35 is within [0.05, 0.6].

6) Cooling coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0):
- Currently 0.80. All zones slightly above 26°C; outside is very hot, so system needs to remove sensible heat from recirculated + OA air.
- With zone dampers for hotter zones high and OA slightly higher, some added load appears; dropping coil too much could let temps climb toward upper band.
- To balance energy vs comfort, make a small reduction from 0.80 to 0.75; this saves some chiller energy while relying on existing cool zone temps and airflow to maintain comfort. If zones start drifting up, future steps can correct.
- 0.75 is within [0.06, 1.0].

7) Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4):
- Currently 0.80. Airflow affects both cooling delivery and CO2 removal.
- Since we just nudged OA up and reduced coil slightly, keeping fan at 0.80 helps maintain effective cooling and ventilation without extra energy.
- No change: stay at 0.80 (well within [0.45, 1.4]).

8) Summary of intended effects:
- Comfort: Slightly reduced coil but maintained moderate-high fan and strong dampers for warmer zones should keep temps near 26–26.7°C, within the comfort band.
- CO2: Slight OA increase plus more air to Z2 and Z3 improves dilution, aiming to keep CO2 close to or below 1000 ppm and well below 1100 ppm.
- Energy: Coil reduced (0.80→0.75) with stable fan; zone damper redistribution and modest OA increase add some load but net effect should reduce power somewhat relative to prior step while maintaining comfort and IAQ.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C band but slightly warm relative to 26°C setpoint:
  • Z1: 26.3°C (error +0.3, slowly cooling)
  • Z2: 26.6°C (error +0.6, slowly cooling)
  • Z3: 26.8°C (error +0.8, roughly flat trend)
  • Z4: 26.5°C (error +0.5, roughly flat trend)
- CO₂: All zones below 1000 ppm, but Z1 (988) and Z3 (994) are close to target; trends are slightly downward, so ventilation is currently adequate.
- Outdoor: 35.7°C and rising; outdoor air is much hotter than desired indoor temperature. Extra OA hurts cooling energy and thermal comfort but may help CO₂.
- Previous actions: fairly high cooling/airflow
  • Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.75, 0.98, 0.7]
  • OA damper: 0.35 (moderate)
  • Coil valve: 0.75 (strong cooling)
  • Fan speed: 0.8 (moderately high)

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are within band but biased warm, with slow or flat cooling. Given high outdoor temperature, we should maintain effective cooling but avoid overshooting or unnecessary energy.
- CO₂ is just under 1000 ppm in Z1 and Z3 and slowly decreasing, so we can slightly reduce OA to cut heat load and energy while staying under CO₂ limits.
- Fan and coil are currently strong. Z3 is warmest and nearly not cooling; Z2 also on the warm side. Maintain fairly strong cooling but modestly reduce both coil valve and fan to lower power while keeping enough capacity to pull zones toward 26°C.
- Zone-level distribution: keep or slightly increase flow to warmer zones (Z2, Z3), and slightly reduce to cooler/better zones (Z1, Z4) to save energy and balance comfort.

3) Concrete adjustments:
- Zone dampers:
  • Z3 (26.8°C, 994 ppm, flat temp): keep very high damper but avoid max to reduce fan energy slightly. Reduce from 0.98 → 0.95.
  • Z2 (26.6°C, 959 ppm, slight cooling): maintain or very slightly increase to help it cool. 0.75 → 0.78.
  • Z1 (26.3°C, 988 ppm, cooling): can afford a small reduction, but keep reasonably high to continue slow cooling and maintain CO₂. 0.8 → 0.78.
  • Z4 (26.5°C, 850 ppm): good CO₂ and moderate temp; reduce a bit to shift capacity to warmer zones and save energy. 0.7 → 0.65.
  This keeps overall airflow similar but biases it toward Z2/Z3.

- OA damper:
  • CO₂ is < 1000 ppm and trending down; outdoor air is very hot. Reduce OA slightly to lower chiller and fan load while keeping enough fresh air.
  • 0.35 → 0.30 (still above minimum 0.05 and should keep CO₂ drifting down or at least stable over 5 minutes).

- Coil valve:
  • Zones are warmish and outdoor is very hot. We should continue strong cooling, but can trim slightly to save energy because temps are comfortably within band, not at the upper limit.
  • 0.75 → 0.70 to reduce chiller/pump power but keep substantial capacity.

- Fan speed:
  • At 0.8, with high zone dampers, airflow is good. A small reduction will cut fan energy while maintaining comfort, especially since coil remains strong and zone dampers stay relatively open.
  • 0.8 → 0.75 (still well above minimum 0.45, so airflow remains robust).

4) Check against constraints:
- Zone dampers: all within [0.05, 1.0]
  • [0.78, 0.78, 0.95, 0.65]
- OA damper: 0.30 within [0.05, 0.6]
- Coil valve: 0.70 within [0.06, 1.0]
- Fan speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4]

5) Expected reward impact:
- Comfort: Slightly increased cooling bias for warmer zones should gently pull all zones toward 26°C, staying well within 25–27°C.
- CO₂: Small OA reduction may slightly slow the CO₂ decrease, but with current levels below 1000 ppm and negative trends, risk of crossing 1000 or 1100 ppm in 5 minutes is low.
- Power: Lower fan speed, coil valve, and OA fraction all reduce energy use while preserving comfort and IAQ, improving the reward trade-off.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.78, 0.78, 0.95, 0.65], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C with comfort band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm; violation if any zone > 1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy via fan_speed, coil_valve, dampers.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 26.3°C (slightly above setpoint but within band), temp trend ~0°C/min (flat), CO2 996 ppm rising at +1.5 ppm/min. In 5 min: ~996 + 1.5*5 = 1003.5 ppm (slightly above 1000 but below 1100).
- Zone 2: 26.5°C (slightly warm, within band), cooling very slowly (-0.01°C/min), CO2 961 ppm, trend +0.5 ppm/min → ~963.5 ppm in 5 min.
- Zone 3: 26.8°C (near upper band), trend flat, CO2 1001 ppm with +1.2 ppm/min → 1007 ppm in 5 min. This is already above 1000 target and rising; closest to CO2 constraints.
- Zone 4: 26.6°C rising slightly, CO2 856 ppm rising; still safe.

Outdoor air: 35.8°C and rising. So OA is significantly hotter than indoor; more OA improves CO2 but worsens thermal load and energy. Need a careful balance, especially for Zone 3 which is both warm and slightly CO2-high.

Previous actions (baseline):
- Zone dampers: [0.78, 0.78, 0.95, 0.65]
- OA damper: 0.30
- Coil valve: 0.70
- Fan speed: 0.75

Given all zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band but trending slightly warm (or flat) under a hot outdoor condition, aggressive energy reduction could risk drifting upper-band, especially for Zone 3. Also, Zone 3 CO2 is just over 1000 ppm and rising, so we should not reduce ventilation for that zone; better to slightly increase its airflow and modestly increase OA fraction while keeping cooling capacity adequate.

2) Strategy by actuator:
- Zone dampers: keep relatively high for Zone 3 to manage both temperature and CO2; small boosts to other zones that are near upper band but avoid large increases that would raise fan energy. Also we can slightly reduce where CO2 is low and comfort is okay to save energy.
  * Zone 3: already high at 0.95; keep high or very slightly adjust. Increasing to 1.0 gives more flow and better CO2/temperature control at the expense of some energy; likely beneficial because CO2 is over target and near violation range long-term.
  * Zone 1: 26.3°C and CO2 near 1000; keep similar or slightly up to slow any warming and improve CO2. But we should not overdo; 0.80 is a mild increase.
  * Zone 2: 26.5°C and moderate CO2; 0.78 is fine; small bump to 0.80 keeps comfort stable given hot outdoor.
  * Zone 4: 26.6°C rising; but CO2 is low (856). Its priority is temperature, not CO2. We can maintain 0.65 to avoid extra energy rather than increase, because coil and fan adjustments will help cooling globally.

- OA damper: currently 0.30. CO2 in Zone 3 and Zone 1 is around/above target and rising, but still far from 1100 ppm. However, because we want to avoid approaching the violation threshold and there is a specific CO2_penalty_weight plus violation penalty, a slight increase in OA is justified. But outdoor is 35.8°C, much hotter, so big increases would heavily increase cooling load. A modest nudge from 0.30 to about 0.33–0.35 gives a better CO2 trajectory without huge energy penalty. I'll choose 0.35 as a balanced compromise.

- Coil valve (cooling capacity): 0.70 with supply likely reasonably cool. Zones are all above 26°C and Zone 3 is 26.8°C not yet cooling. With hotter OA and slightly increased OA damper, we should not reduce coil. Slight increase will help gently pull down zone temps toward 26°C center and offset hotter OA while keeping within energy limits. Move from 0.70 to 0.75 (small step) to improve comfort and help counteract any extra heat from added OA.

- Fan speed: 0.75 currently. Increasing OA fraction and slightly opening Zone 3 damper could increase static, but we are in a moderate range (min 0.45, max 1.4). CO2 penalties and comfort are presently more significant than power: power_weight is 0.2, CO2_penalty_weight is 0.5 plus large violation penalty. A small increase in fan speed can help deliver more cool air and dilute CO2, particularly to Zone 3, without a huge power hit. Going from 0.75 to 0.80 is a cautious increment; larger jumps (e.g., >0.9) may overshoot energy-wise given we are already in-band for temperature. So set fan_speed = 0.80.

3) Check against bounds and overall trade-offs:
- Action bounds:
  * zone_dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
  * oa_damper: [0.05, 0.6]
  * coil_valve: [0.06, 1.0]
  * fan_speed: [0.45, 1.4]
All proposed values are safely within bounds.

Trade-offs:
- Slight increases in OA and fan and coil raise power but improve comfort (cooling zones slightly closer to 26°C) and reduce CO2 risk, particularly for Zone 3 which is already above the 1000-ppm target. Given the strong CO2 penalty weight and large violation penalty at 1100 ppm, proactively nudging ventilation and airflow is likely to increase the overall reward more than a small power reduction would.
- Zone-damper tweaks are minor; most of the CO2 and comfort effect will come from OA, fan, and coil. Keeping Zone 3 damper at 1.0 prioritizes the most constrained zone.

4) Final chosen setpoints (clipped within bounds):
- zone_dampers: [0.8, 0.8, 1.0, 0.65]
- oa_damper: 0.35

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- All zones are within comfort band:
  - Z1: 26.3°C (0.3 above setpoint), cooling slowly (−0.01 °C/min)
  - Z2: 26.5°C (0.5 above), cooling slowly
  - Z3: 26.8°C (0.8 above), cooling slowly
  - Z4: 26.6°C (0.6 above), flat trend so far
- In 5 minutes, with current trends (assuming plant effect roughly reflected):
  - Z1: ~26.25°C
  - Z2: ~26.45°C
  - Z3: ~26.75°C
  - Z4: ~26.6°C
  All remain within 25–27°C, though Z3 is close to 27°C upper comfort edge.

- CO₂ status vs constraints:
  - Target <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
  - Z1: 989 ppm, trending down −1.4 ppm/min → ~982 ppm in 5 min.
  - Z2: 952 ppm, −1.7 ppm/min → ~943 ppm.
  - Z3: 995 ppm, −1.1 ppm/min → ~990 ppm.
  - Z4: 854 ppm, −0.4 ppm/min → ~852 ppm.
  All are below 1000 ppm and trending downward, so we have some ventilation margin and low risk of crossing 1000 or 1100 ppm in the next interval.

- Outdoor air: 35.4°C, trending down but still much hotter than indoors. Extra OA brings strong heat load, increasing coil and fan energy.
- Previous actions:
  - Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.8, 1.0, 0.65]
  - OA damper: 0.35
  - Coil valve: 0.75
  - Fan speed: 0.8
  These are relatively high, providing strong cooling and ventilation, probably more than needed to maintain comfort and CO₂ given current readings and downward CO₂ trends.

2) Strategy to maximize reward:
Reward penalizes power use and CO₂, plus comfort deviations. All zones are in band and cooling; CO₂ is below target and declining. We should:
- Gently reduce cooling and airflow to cut energy while ensuring:
  - Z3 stays below 27°C and near 26°C.
  - CO₂ remains well below 1000 ppm.
- Since OA is hot and CO₂ is already falling, we can safely reduce OA fraction to cut load.
- Maintain enough fan flow and zone damper opening, especially for Zone 3, to avoid it drifting upwards.

3) Actuator-by-actuator decisions (qualitative):
- Coil valve (0.06–1.0): Currently 0.75. With all zones near setpoint and trending down, we can lower coil to reduce chiller energy. However, outdoor is very hot, and Zone 3 is close to upper band. If we cut too much, Z3 may warm. A modest reduction to about 0.65 should still keep net cooling while reducing energy.

- Fan speed (0.45–1.4): Currently 0.8. Lower fan reduces fan power and reheat from recirculated air; but also reduces cooling delivery and CO₂ removal. Since CO₂ is trending down and temps are trending down or flat, we can slightly decrease fan speed. Moving to about 0.7 is a balanced step: less energy, but maintains adequate airflow.

- OA damper (0.05–0.6): Currently 0.35. OA is 35.4°C ⇒ significant sensible load; CO₂ is below target and decreasing even at 0.35. We can reduce OA to lower coil load, accepting somewhat slower CO₂ decay but still staying safely below 1000 ppm. A moderate reduction to ~0.25 maintains some fresh air but reduces heat load.

- Zone dampers (0.05–1.0):
  - Priority is Zone 3 (hottest, highest CO₂). Keep Z3 damper relatively open but can slightly reduce due to high fan and coil still providing cooling. From 1.0 → 0.9.
  - Z1 and Z2 are similar (mid-26s, CO₂ under control). We can modestly close them to reduce overcooling and redistribute some capacity: from 0.8 → 0.7 each.
  - Z4 is cooler in CO₂ and similar temperature; it was already more restricted at 0.65. We can reduce slightly to cut energy while still comfortable: 0.65 → 0.6.

4) Check interactions and risks over the next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures: With fan 0.7 and coil 0.65 (vs 0.8/0.75), cooling rate will slightly weaken. Given current trends are negative (cooling), the rate might move closer to 0 or mild cooling. Z3 at 26.8°C is likely to stay under 27°C over 5 minutes; even if cooling essentially stops, thermal inertia and short horizon limit its warming.
- CO₂: Slightly less OA and fan will slow the decrease, but starting just under 1000 ppm (worst case Z3 = 995 ppm) and trending downward, it should remain below 1000 and far from 1100 in the next 5 min.
- Energy: Reduced OA, coil, fan, and slightly more balancing on dampers will reduce overall power, improving reward without significant comfort or CO₂ penalties.

5) Bounds check and final numeric choices:
- Zone dampers: [0.7, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.25 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.65 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.7 within [0.45, 1.4].

We can modestly close them to reduce overcooling and redistribute some capacity: from 0.8 → 0.7 each.\n  - Z4 is cooler in CO₂ and similar temperature; it was already more restricted at 0.65. We can reduce slightly to cut energy while still comfortable: 0.65 → 0.6.\n\n4) Check interactions and risks over the next 5 minutes:\n- Temperatures: With fan 0.7 and coil 0.65 (vs 0.8/0.75), cooling rate will slightly weaken. Given current trends are negative (cooling), the rate might move closer to 0 or mild cooling. Z3 at 26.8°C is likely to stay under 27°C over 5 minutes; even if cooling essentially stops, thermal inertia and short horizon limit its warming.\n- CO₂: Slightly less OA and fan will slow the decrease, but starting just under 1000 ppm (worst case Z3 = 995 ppm) and trending downward, it should remain below 1000 and far from 1100 in the next 5 min.\n- Energy: Reduced OA, coil, fan, and slightly more balancing on dampers will reduce overall power, improving reward without significant comfort or CO₂ penalties.\n\n5) Bounds check and final numeric choices:\n- Zone dampers: [0.7, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6] all within [0.05, 1.0].\n- OA damper: 0.25 within [0.05, 0.6].\n- Coil valve: 0.65 within [0.06, 1.0].\n- Fan speed: 0.7 within [0.45, 1.4].\nThese are directly usable, no clipping needed."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs goals:
- Thermal comfort target band: 25–27°C around a 26°C center.
- Zone temps: Z1=26.3, Z2=26.5, Z3=26.8, Z4=26.6°C.
  • All zones are inside the 25–27°C comfort band, but Z3 (26.8) and Z2/Z4 (26.5–26.6) are drifting warm side.
  • Temperature trends are near 0, so without more cooling they’ll likely stay warm or slowly drift up given hot outdoor conditions (35.1°C).
- CO2 levels: Z1=1011 ppm (above 1000 target, slightly rising), Z3=1010 ppm (slightly above target, rising), Z2=968 ppm (just below target, rising), Z4=865 ppm (safe, rising).
  • No zone is near 1100 ppm violation threshold yet, but Z1 and Z3 have just crossed target and are trending upward.
- Previous actions: zone dampers [0.7, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6], OA damper 0.25, coil 0.65, fan 0.7.

2) Competing objectives over next 5 minutes:
- Maintain temps well within band without overshooting cold (since comfort reward is centered at 26 with sigma 0.25, too cold also hurts reward). Slight extra cooling is OK because most zones are above 26 and close to upper half of band.
- Reduce or at least arrest CO2 increases, especially in Zones 1 and 3 (>1000 ppm and rising) to avoid growing CO2 penalty and risk of future violation.
- Minimize energy: lower fan and coil where possible, but not at the expense of big comfort/CO2 penalties.
- Given outdoor is very hot (35.1°C) and only moderately trending cooler, we should not increase OA excessively (would add heat + fan energy), but some boost to OA plus distribution to high-CO2 zones is warranted.

3) Strategy for each actuator:
A) Zone dampers (0.05–1.0):
- Goal: Prioritize airflow to hotter and higher-CO2 zones, and slightly reduce to cooler/cleaner zones if needed.
- Zone 3: Warmest (26.8) and high CO2 (1010). Keep damper high or slightly increase to push more cool, fresh air. However, it’s already 0.9 (near max), and bumping to 1.0 has diminishing returns and slightly more fan power, but can help both temp and CO2. A small increase to 0.95 balances benefit vs energy.
- Zone 1: 26.3°C (slightly warm) and 1011 ppm (above target). Needs more ventilation and at least maintain cooling. Increase slightly from 0.7 to 0.8.
- Zone 2: 26.5°C, 968 ppm. Slightly warm but CO2 below target. Maintain or slightly reduce to free airflow for Z1/Z3 without needing more fan. Lower gently from 0.7 to 0.65.
- Zone 4: 26.6°C, 865 ppm. Comfort fine, CO2 quite low. We can modestly reduce damper to lower load and allow more relative flow to Z1/Z3 without total fan increase. Reduce from 0.6 to 0.5.
- These adjustments redistribute airflow while keeping all zones reasonably served.

B) Outdoor air (OA) damper (0.05–0.6):
- CO2 is at/over target in two zones and rising in all. Increasing fresh air fraction is the most direct mitigant, but OA air is very hot (35.1°C), so more OA increases sensible load and coil/fan energy.
- Given violation threshold is 1100 ppm, and we’re just above 1000, a moderate bump is justified to slow/stop CO2 rise without going near max.
- Increase OA damper from 0.25 to 0.3: small step that improves ventilation while limiting added cooling load.

C) Coil valve (0.06–1.0):
- All zones are on the warm side of 26°C, and outdoor is much hotter. If we reduce coil opening, zones may drift up toward or past 27°C, causing comfort penalty.
- To nudge zones a bit closer to 26 while compensating for slightly higher OA fraction, a small increase in cooling is appropriate.
- Increase coil from 0.65 to 0.7: modest extra cooling that should pull Z3 down from 26.8 and keep others near 26–26.5 without overshooting cold.

D) Fan speed (0.45–1.4):
- Higher fan improves both cooling delivery and CO2 removal but raises power_kw directly. We already increased coil and redistribution of zone dampers, plus a small OA increase. A large fan increase would add significant energy cost.
- With better zoning and slightly more OA, fan can likely stay at current level or even slightly trimmed, but trimming could worsen CO2 trends and temps with hot OA.
- Maintain fan at 0.7: balances energy vs comfort/CO2. Previous step appears to be sustaining temps (near-zero temp deltas), so minimal change avoids unnecessary energy spikes or comfort risk.

4) Sanity check vs bounds and objectives:
- All proposed values are inside given bounds.
- This action: 
  • Increases airflow and cooling to the most constrained zones (Z1, Z3) to address both temperature and CO2.
  • Slightly reduces dampers to less-critical zones to avoid needing extra fan power.
  • Slightly increases OA and coil to improve CO2 while keeping temps within band.
  • Keeps fan speed steady to avoid excess power draw while leveraging better distribution and coil setting.
- Overall, this should improve or maintain comfort and CO2 within constraints over the next 5 minutes while only modestly increasing energy, which should be net-positive for the reward.

5) Final chosen setpoints (clipped to bounds as needed):

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; hard concern as two zones are already above 1000.
- Minimise energy (fan/chiller/pump) without violating comfort/CO2.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 26.3°C (slightly above setpoint but well within band), temp trend -0.01°C/min (slightly cooling already). CO2 = 1016 ppm, rising at +0.9 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ +4.5 ppm → ~1020 ppm. Above target, drifting upward.
- Zone 2: 26.5°C, flat temp. CO2 = 979 ppm, rising +2 ppm/min → +10 ppm → ~989 ppm, near target but still below 1000.
- Zone 3: 26.8°C (near upper band), temp trend flat. CO2 = 1017 ppm, rising +1.3 ppm/min → ~1023 ppm, above target and rising.
- Zone 4: 26.7°C, slight warming. CO2 = 873 ppm, rising +1.5 ppm/min → ~880–881 ppm, safe.

Outdoor: 35.2°C and rising → very hot, so additional outdoor air has a strong cooling penalty via coil/chiller energy.

Current actuators:
- Zone dampers: Z1=0.8, Z2=0.65, Z3=0.95, Z4=0.5 (0.05–1.0).
- OA damper: 0.3 (0.05–0.6).
- Coil valve: 0.7 (0.06–1.0).
- Fan speed: 0.7 (0.45–1.4).

2) Key trade-offs:
- CO2: Zones 1 & 3 already slightly above 1000 ppm and increasing. To reduce/pull down toward target we primarily need more ventilation (OA damper and/or fan). Zone dampers can prioritize more air to high-CO2/high-temp zones.
- Temperature: All zones are within the 25–27°C band, but Zones 3 and 4 are closer to upper limit and Zone 3 is closest at 26.8°C with flat trend. Any increase in OA with 35.2°C outside air will add thermal load, requiring more coil cooling or leading to temperatures drifting up.
- Energy: Increasing OA and fan speed increases power and required cooling. However, comfort_reward and CO2 penalties typically outweigh modest energy changes when near/over limits, so we should bias toward addressing CO2 and preventing temperature from exceeding 27°C.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- CO2 control priority: Need more outside air and distribution to Zones 1 & 3, but without big overshoot in energy.
- Temperature control: Slightly more cooling to keep Zone 3 from crossing 27°C as we bring in warmer OA.
- Energy: Make modest, not extreme, changes from previous actions to avoid unnecessary power spikes.

4) Actuator-by-actuator reasoning:

4.1 Zone dampers (per-zone flow allocation):
Goal: Give relatively more air to Zones 1 & 3 (high CO2 & higher temp), moderate to Zone 2, slightly less to Zone 4 (lowest CO2 and relatively cooler/less critical).
- Zone 1: Currently 0.8, CO2 above target and rising, temp slightly above setpoint but trending down. Keeping or slightly increasing flow helps purge CO2 and maintain cooling. Increase a bit: set to 0.85.
- Zone 2: Currently 0.65, CO2 just under 1000 but rising, temp mid-band. Slight support but not as aggressive as Zones 1 & 3. Keep roughly similar: 0.65.
- Zone 3: Currently 0.95, hottest and above CO2 target. This zone should keep very high flow for both cooling and CO2 dilution. Can go to the max 1.0 for the interval: 1.0.
- Zone 4: Currently 0.5, lowest CO2 and moderately warm but still below upper band. Since we will increase OA and maintain cooling, this zone will still get adequate conditioning; can afford slightly lower fraction to favor Zones 1 & 3. Reduce a bit to 0.45.
All within [0.05, 1.0].

4.2 OA damper:
Need a bump to address CO2 in Zones 1 & 3. However, OA air is very hot (35.2°C), so a large increase would significantly raise cooling energy and risk temps drifting up if coil is not increased. But CO2 penalties and potential violation penalty near 1100 ppm are strong; also present levels are only slightly above 1000, so a moderate increase may suffice.
- Current OA: 0.3.
- Proposed: raise OA modestly to improve ventilation but not near max: 0.38. This gives a ~27% increase relative to 0.3 (0.38/0.3 ≈ 1.27), which should help CO2 without huge extra load.

4.3 Coil valve (cooling capacity):
More OA at 35.2°C adds load, and Zone 3 is already at 26.8°C with flat trend. We want to avoid crossing 27°C, so coil should be slightly stronger, but not extreme given energy penalty.
- Current: 0.7.
- Proposed: 0.75 to slightly increase cooling, compensating for hotter OA and keeping temps central in band.

4.4 Fan speed:
Fan affects both airflow volume (thus ventilation and cooling distribution) and power. Since CO2 is over target in 2 zones and we have increased OA somewhat, a small increase in fan speed improves actual outside air delivery and zone ventilation effectiveness.
- Current: 0.7.
- Proposed: 0.75 — modest bump for better ventilation and distribution with moderate power increase. This, combined with rebalanced zone dampers, should pull CO2 trajectories down or at least flatten them.

5) Sanity check vs bounds:
- Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.65, 1.0, 0.45] → all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.38 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.75 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4].

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures: Slightly increased cooling (coil 0.75) and high flow to Zone 3 (1.0 damper) should hold or slightly reduce temps in hotter zones despite a bit more hot OA. Zones 1 and 2 likely stay around 26–26.5°C, Zone 3 should stay under 27°C, Zone 4 likely near current.
- CO2: Higher OA, higher fan, and favoring Zones 1 & 3 should reduce or flatten CO2 rise; they may remain somewhat above 1000 ppm but closer to target and further from the 1100 ppm violation threshold.

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current state vs objectives:\n- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.\n- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; hard concern as two zones are already above 1000.\n- Minimise energy (fan/chiller/pump) without violating comfort/CO2.\n\nZone conditions:\n- Zone 1: 26.3°C (slightly above setpoint but well within band), temp trend -0.01°C/min (slightly cooling already). CO2 = 1016 ppm, rising at +0.9 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ +4.5 ppm → ~1020 ppm. Above target, drifting upward.\n- Zone 2: 26.5°C, flat temp. CO2 = 979 ppm, rising +2 ppm/min → +10 ppm → ~989 ppm, near target but still below 1000.\n- Zone 3: 26.8°C (near upper band), temp trend flat. CO2 = 1017 ppm, rising +1.3 ppm/min → ~1023 ppm, above target and rising.\n- Zone 4: 26.7°C, slight warming. CO2 = 873 ppm, rising +1.5 ppm/min → ~880–881 ppm, safe.\n\nOutdoor: 35.2°C and rising → very hot, so additional outdoor air has a strong cooling penalty via coil/chiller energy.\n\nCurrent actuators:\n- Zone dampers: Z1=0.8, Z2=0.65, Z3=0.95, Z4=0.5 (0.05–1.0).\n- OA damper: 0.3 (0.05–0.6).\n- Coil valve: 0.7 (0.06–1.0).\n- Fan speed: 0.7 (0.45–1.4).\n\n2) Key trade-offs:\n- CO2: Zones 1 & 3 already slightly above 1000 ppm and increasing. To reduce/pull down toward target we primarily need more ventilation (OA damper and/or fan). Zone dampers can prioritize more air to high-CO2/high-temp zones.\n- Temperature: All zones are within the 25–27°C band, but Zones 3 and 4 are closer to upper limit and Zone 3 is closest at 26.8°C with flat trend. Any increase in OA with 35.2°C outside air will add thermal load, requiring more coil cooling or leading to temperatures drifting up.\n- Energy: Increasing OA and fan speed increases power and required cooling. However, comfort_reward and CO2 penalties typically outweigh modest energy changes when near/over limits, so we should bias toward addressing CO2 and preventing temperature from exceeding 27°C.\n\n3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:\n- CO2 control priority: Need more outside air and distribution to Zones 1 & 3, but without big overshoot in energy.\n- Temperature control: Slightly more cooling to keep Zone 3 from crossing 27°C as we bring in warmer OA.\n- Energy: Make modest, not extreme, changes from previous actions to avoid unnecessary power spikes.\n\n4) Actuator-by-actuator reasoning:\n\n4.1 Zone dampers (per-zone flow allocation):\nGoal: Give relatively more air to Zones 1 & 3 (high CO2 & higher temp), moderate to Zone 2, slightly less to Zone 4 (lowest CO2 and relatively cooler/less critical).\n- Zone 1: Currently 0.8, CO2 above target and rising, temp slightly above setpoint but trending down. Keeping or slightly increasing flow helps purge CO2 and maintain cooling. Increase a bit: set to 0.85.\n- Zone 2: Currently 0.65, CO2 just under 1000 but rising, temp mid-band. Slight support but not as aggressive as Zones 1 & 3. Keep roughly similar: 0.65.\n- Zone 3: Currently 0.95, hottest and above CO2 target. This zone should keep very high flow for both cooling and CO2 dilution. Can go to the max 1.0 for the interval: 1.0.\n- Zone 4: Currently 0.5, lowest CO2 and moderately warm but still below upper band. Since we will increase OA and maintain cooling, this zone will still get adequate conditioning; can afford slightly lower fraction to favor Zones 1 & 3. Reduce a bit to 0.45.\nAll within [0.05, 1.0].\n\n4.2 OA damper:\nNeed a bump to address CO2 in Zones 1 & 3. However, OA air is very hot (35.2°C), so a large increase would significantly raise cooling energy and risk temps drifting up if coil is not increased. But CO2 penalties and potential violation penalty near 1100 ppm are strong; also present levels are only slightly above 1000, so a moderate increase may suffice.\n- Current OA: 0.3.\n- Proposed: raise OA modestly to improve ventilation but not near max: 0.38. This gives a ~27% increase relative to 0.3 (0.38/0.3 ≈ 1.27), which should help CO2 without huge extra load.\n\n4.3 Coil valve (cooling capacity):\nMore OA at 35.2°C adds load, and Zone 3 is already at 26.8°C with flat trend. We want to avoid crossing 27°C, so coil should be slightly stronger, but not extreme given energy penalty.\n- Current: 0.7.\n- Proposed: 0.75 to slightly increase cooling, compensating for hotter OA and keeping temps central in band.\n\n4.4 Fan speed:\nFan affects both airflow volume (thus ventilation and cooling distribution) and power. Since CO2 is over target in 2 zones and we have increased OA somewhat, a small increase in fan speed improves actual outside air delivery and zone ventilation effectiveness.\n- Current: 0.7.\n- Proposed: 0.75 — modest bump for better ventilation and distribution with moderate power increase. This, combined with rebalanced zone dampers, should pull CO2 trajectories down or at least flatten them.\n\n5) Sanity check vs bounds:\n- Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.65, 1.0, 0.45] → all within [0.05, 1.0].\n- OA damper: 0.38 within [0.05, 0.6].\n- Coil valve: 0.75 within [0.06, 1.0].\n- Fan speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4].\n\n6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:\n- Temperatures: Slightly increased cooling (coil 0.75) and high flow to Zone 3 (1.0 damper) should hold or slightly reduce temps in hotter zones despite a bit more hot OA. Zones 1 and 2 likely stay around 26–26.5°C, Zone 3 should stay under 27°C, Zone 4 likely near current.\n- CO2: Higher OA, higher fan, and favoring Zones 1 & 3 should reduce or flatten CO2 rise; they may remain somewhat above 1000 ppm but closer to target and further from the 1100 ppm violation threshold.\n- Energy: Fan and coil increases are modest, balancing CO2/comfort vs power penalty.\n\nTherefore the following action should reasonably maximise the reward for the upcoming interval given the trade-offs."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current conditions vs. goals:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO₂ target: <1000 ppm; hard violation at 1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy: keep fan speed, coil valve, and outdoor-air (OA) damper as low as possible while meeting comfort and CO₂.

Zone status:
- Zone 1: 26.2°C (slightly above target but well within 25–27°C), cooling trend –0.01°C/min → over 5 min ≈ –0.05°C → forecast ≈ 26.15°C. CO₂ 999 ppm, trending –3 ppm/min → over 5 min ≈ –15 ppm → forecast ≈ 984 ppm (safely below 1000).
- Zone 2: 26.5°C, flat temperature (0°C/min) → forecast ≈ 26.5°C (comfortable). CO₂ 975 ppm, –1 ppm/min → forecast ≈ 970 ppm.
- Zone 3: 26.7°C (upper half of band), cooling –0.01°C/min → forecast ≈ 26.65°C (still fine). CO₂ 1005 ppm (slightly above 1000 target but below 1100 threshold), –2.2 ppm/min → over 5 min ≈ –11 ppm → forecast ≈ 994 ppm (back below target).
- Zone 4: 26.8°C (a bit warm, near band top), warming +0.02°C/min → over 5 min ≈ +0.1°C → forecast ≈ 26.9°C (just under 27°C limit). CO₂ 872 ppm, –0.4 ppm/min → ≈ 870 ppm (no issue).

Overall: all zones remain within 25–27°C in the next 5 minutes even with slightly reduced cooling, and CO₂ for all zones is projected below 1000 ppm with current ventilation. No risk of CO₂ violation >1100 ppm this interval. Thus, we can reduce energy use while staying safe.

2) Evaluate current actuators:
- Previous zone dampers: [Z1: 0.85, Z2: 0.65, Z3: 1.00, Z4: 0.45] (relative supply to each zone).
- OA damper: 0.38 (out of [0.05, 0.6]).
- Coil valve: 0.75 (fairly high cooling, [0.06–1.0]).
- Fan speed: 0.75 (above minimum 0.45).

Energy saving levers:
- Lower fan speed → reduces fan power significantly.
- Lower coil valve → reduces chiller/pump energy.
- Lower OA damper → reduces outside hot air load but also reduces CO₂ dilution.
- Adjust zone dampers to fine-tune which zones receive more/less air without big fan changes.

3) CO₂ considerations / OA damper choice:
- Critical zone for CO₂ is Zone 3: 1005 ppm but trending down at –2.2 ppm/min with current OA=0.38 and fan=0.75.
- Over 5 minutes, Z3 is expected ≈994 ppm even if we slightly reduce OA/fan, but we must avoid reversing the downward trend too aggressively.
- Outdoor temperature is very hot (35.4°C, rising), so OA brings a large cooling penalty, but CO₂ is close enough to the 1000 target that dropping OA too much could stall or reverse the CO₂ improvement, increasing the co2_penalty term.

Trade-off: modest OA reduction from 0.38 to about 0.30 should still maintain some CO₂ decrease while cutting load. Going too low (e.g., 0.10) could cause Z3 CO₂ to rise back above 1000 and increase the penalty.

Chosen OA damper: 0.30 (within [0.05, 0.6]). This is a moderate reduction that balances CO₂ and energy.

4) Coil valve (cooling) decision:
- All zones are either slightly above or near target 26°C but comfortably inside 25–27°C.
- Z4 is the warmest and even increasing slightly; we do not want to drastically cut cooling such that Z4 rises above 27°C.
- However, forecast with *current* coil=0.75 shows Z4 ending at ≈26.9°C. We can likely reduce cooling a bit and still stay under 27°C.

Effect of lowering coil:
- Slightly warmer supply air will reduce overall cooling rate. Zones that are currently cooling slowly might cool less or even warm slightly.
- To protect Z4 (warmest), we can slightly bias more airflow to Z4 via its damper while lowering overall coil valve.

Given that we only control for the coming 5 minutes, a modest reduction seems safe. For example:
- Decrease coil valve from 0.75 to 0.65: reduces chiller energy while likely keeping temps within band. Z4 may end slightly warmer but should remain under or at ~27°C, especially if we give it more air.

Chosen coil valve: 0.65 (within [0.06, 1.0]) to lower energy with low comfort risk.

5) Fan speed decision:
- Fan power is typically a strong function of speed (roughly cubic), so lowering from 0.75 significantly reduces energy.
- But lower fan → less air to zones → slower cooling and slower CO₂ removal.
- Given we are still within comfort band and CO₂ trends are downward, we can moderately lower fan speed.

Risk analysis for fan reduction:
- CO₂: With OA=0.30 and slightly lower fan (e.g., 0.65), total outside air volume may be somewhat lower than before, but still reasonable. Z3 CO₂ is only slightly above 1000 now and trending downward; a moderate reduction should still avoid large increases over 5 minutes.
- Temperature: Lower fan will reduce sensible cooling delivery. Z4 is borderline warm; we’ll compensate with higher damper for Z4 and ensure coil is not reduced too aggressively (we already went from 0.75 to 0.65, a modest step).

Chosen fan speed: 0.65 (above minimum 0.45). This gives a notable power reduction but likely keeps comfort/CO₂ acceptable over the 5-minute interval.

6) Zone damper rebalancing:
Goal: maintain or improve comfort while we reduce central cooling (coil) and fan speed.
- Warmest zone: Z4 (26.8°C increasing). Needs a bit more air proportionally.
- Coolest / more comfortable: Z1 (26.2°C trending slightly down), Z2 (26.5°C stable), Z3 (26.7°C slightly cooling, upper band).

We want slightly more relative air to Z4 and a bit less to the other zones so that the limited cool air and ventilation capacity focus on the warmest and CO₂-challenged zones.

Current dampers:
- Z1: 0.85 (high, and the zone is already cool and cooling).
- Z2: 0.65 (moderate, comfortable).
- Z3: 1.00 (max, slightly warm and slight CO₂ concern).
- Z4: 0.45 (lowest, but warmest and warming).

Adjustments:
- Z1: reduce damper to cut energy and cooling to the already-comfortable, slightly cooling zone. For example, from 0.85 → 0.70.
- Z2: small reduction to share more air with Z3/Z4, e.g., 0.65 → 0.60.
- Z3: keep high because of both temperature and CO₂; maybe slightly reduce from 1.00 to 0.95 to share a bit with Z4 while staying prioritized.
- Z4: increase to improve comfort and ventilation, from 0.45 → 0.60.

These moves rebalance without extreme swings and help keep Z4 under 27°C while allowing a small reduction in central cooling/fan.

7) Check constraints and final clipping:
Bounds:
- Zone dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
  - Z1=0.70 → within bounds.
  - Z2=0.60 → within bounds.
  - Z3=0.95 → within bounds.
  - Z4=0.60 → within bounds.
- OA damper: [0.05, 0.6] → chosen 0.30 is valid.
- Coil valve: [0.06, 1.0] → chosen 0.65 is valid.
- Fan speed: [0.45, 1.4] → chosen 0.65 is valid.

8) Reward trade-off summary:
- Comfort: Slightly reduced central cooling and fan might raise zone temperatures marginally, but all zones are projected to remain within 25–27°C. Z4, the tightest, is given more air to prevent exceeding 27°C.
- CO₂: OA only modestly lowered (0.38→0.30); fan slightly reduced (0.75→0.65). Z3 CO₂ should remain near or slightly below 1000 ppm, with almost no risk of violating 1100 ppm over 5 minutes. This keeps the co2_penalty small and avoids the violation penalty.
- Power: Lower fan (0.75→0.65), lower coil (0.75→0.65), and somewhat reduced OA fraction together significantly reduce energy, improving the power_weight term.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, violation at > 1100 ppm.
- Minimise power (fan/chiller/pump) while keeping within band and CO2 below target.

Zones (T, dT/dt, CO2, dCO2/dt):
- Zone 1: 26.2°C (slightly above setpoint but well within band), warming +0.01°C/min, CO2 1017 ppm (above 1000 target) rising +3.3 ppm/min.
- Zone 2: 26.6°C, +0.01°C/min, CO2 987 ppm rising +2.4 ppm/min (will likely cross 1000 during interval).
- Zone 3: 26.7°C, flat 0.0°C/min, CO2 1015 ppm rising +1.9 ppm/min.
- Zone 4: 26.8°C, +0.01°C/min, CO2 877 ppm rising slowly.
All zones within temperature comfort band, but 1 and 3 already above CO2 target; 2 is about to exceed it.

Outdoor: 35.3°C, very hot, so more outdoor air raises cooling load significantly.
Previous action:
- Zone dampers: [0.7, 0.6, 0.95, 0.6]
- OA damper: 0.30
- Coil valve: 0.65
- Fan speed: 0.65
Bounds:
- Zone dampers: [0.05, 1.0]
- OA damper: [0.05, 0.6]
- Coil valve: [0.06, 1.0]
- Fan speed: [0.45, 1.4]

2) Qualitative trade-offs:
- CO2 in Zones 1 and 3 is already above target and rising; we want more ventilation to these zones without massively increasing cooling energy.
- Outdoor is much hotter than zones, so increasing OA too much will raise load on coil (more chiller energy) and might warm zones if coil is not increased.
- Temps are mid–upper range of comfort band (26.2–26.8°C) and mostly drifting slightly upward, so a modest increase in cooling is acceptable and might actually improve comfort toward 26°C.
- Fan power is weighted but currently moderate at 0.65 (min 0.45). Increasing fan a bit can improve both cooling delivery and CO2 dilution. Relative to OA increase, boosting fan speed while keeping OA moderate is often more energy-efficient for CO2 control when outdoor is very hot.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
CO2 dynamics over 5 minutes if we did nothing (approximate):
- Zone 1: 1017 + 3.3*5 ≈ 1033 ppm.
- Zone 2: 987 + 2.4*5 ≈ 999 ppm.
- Zone 3: 1015 + 1.9*5 ≈ 1025 ppm.
- Zone 4: 877 + 1.1*5 ≈ 882 ppm.
That keeps all below the 1100 violation threshold but above target in 1 and 3, and on the edge in 2. It might be acceptable for 5 minutes, but the RL reward has explicit CO2 penalties above target. Slightly increasing ventilation to high-CO2 zones and a modest OA increase will reduce the growth rate and maybe flatten or reverse it, improving reward with limited energy increase.

Actions by actuator:
A) Zone dampers:
- Focus on Zones 1 and 3 (highest CO2), modest on 2, possibly slightly reduce on 4 (low CO2 and high temp) to avoid oversupplying.
- Avoid extreme changes to limit fan energy and overshoot.
Proposed adjustments from previous:
- Zone 1: 0.70 → 0.80 (more fresh/cool air for CO2 and cooling).
- Zone 2: 0.60 → 0.65 (slight increase, as CO2 is near target and temp a bit high).
- Zone 3: 0.95 → 1.00 (max damper; highest CO2 and near top of band temperature).
- Zone 4: 0.60 → 0.55 (slight reduction; CO2 low and temp highest, but we will increase overall cooling via coil/fan so we don’t want to starve it, just balance supply).
All within [0.05, 1.0].

B) Outdoor air (OA) damper:
- Currently 0.30. Outdoor 35.3°C is much hotter than supply. Increasing OA significantly will drive chiller load.
- CO2 is only moderately above target and well below violation, so we should use a modest OA bump, not a large one.
- Propose 0.30 → 0.35: small increase to help CO2 while controlling energy.
Within [0.05, 0.6].

C) Coil valve:
- Current 0.65. Zone temps are slightly warm and trending up; we can modestly increase cooling to pull them slightly closer to 26°C while offsetting added OA load.
- Large increases toward 1.0 would increase chiller power and risk overcooling; small step likely enough over 5 minutes.
- Propose 0.65 → 0.70.
Within [0.06, 1.0].

D) Fan speed:
- Current 0.65, min 0.45. Fan power grows roughly with cubic of speed, so big increases are costly.
- To enhance both CO2 dilution and cooling distribution (especially to Zones 1 and 3 whose dampers we are opening more), a small increase is justified.
- Propose 0.65 → 0.70: modest increment balancing performance vs energy.
Within [0.45, 1.4].

4) Anticipated effects over the interval:
- Increased fan speed and zone dampers (1,2,3) + modest OA bump should reduce CO2 growth, roughly flattening or slightly improving CO2 for high zones while staying far from 1100 ppm.
- Coil increase should counteract any additional sensible load from higher OA and airflow, preventing temperature drift above 27°C and possibly nudging zones closer to 26°C setpoint.
- Power increases (fan, coil, some extra OA load) are kept small to limit power_kw contribution to the negative reward term.

5) Clip to bounds and finalize:
- All chosen values already satisfy specified bounds, so no further clipping is needed.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.65, 1.0, 0.55], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Comfort: All zone temps are within the 25–27°C band but biased a bit warm relative to 26°C center:
  • Z1: 26.2°C (slightly above center, drifting ~flat)
  • Z2: 26.6°C (0.6°C high, slowly rising)
  • Z3: 26.7°C (0.7°C high, ~flat)
  • Z4: 26.9°C (0.9°C high, slowly rising)
- CO2 vs 1000 ppm target:
  • Z1: 1013 ppm, slightly above target but decreasing (-0.7 ppm/min → ~-3.5 over 5 min)
  • Z2: 989 ppm, slightly below target but increasing (+0.3 ppm/min → ~+1.5)
  • Z3: 1014 ppm, slightly above target but decreasing (-0.2 ppm/min → ~-1)
  • Z4: 877 ppm, well below target, slowly increasing (+0.1 ppm/min → ~+0.5)
  All zones are comfortably below the 1100 ppm violation threshold. Main goal is to stay near/below 1000 without over-ventilating.
- Outdoor air: Very hot at 35.2°C. Extra OA for CO2 control is expensive thermally.
- Previous actions:
  • Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.65, 1.0, 0.55]
  • OA damper: 0.35
  • Coil valve: 0.7
  • Fan speed: 0.7
  These suggest moderate fan, fairly strong cooling, and relatively open dampers (especially Z3 and Z1) with moderate OA.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are on the warm side of the band, so we should maintain or very slightly increase cooling capacity to bring zones closer to 26°C, but not aggressively (to avoid energy penalty and overshoot below 25°C).
- CO2 is near but not above target. Z1 and Z3 are just above target but already trending down with current OA (0.35) and damper positions. Z2 is slightly below target but trending up; Z4 is well below. There is no need to increase OA; instead, we can slightly reduce OA to cut cooling load and fan energy, while ensuring CO2 does not start trending sharply upward.
- Zone-by-zone damper adjustments:
  • Z3: warmest (26.7) and above CO2 target (1014, decreasing). Keep near high position to improve cooling and maintain CO2 decrease, but can very slightly reduce from 1.0 to reduce excessive flow and fan power.
  • Z4: warmest (26.9) but CO2 is low (877). It needs cooling but not much ventilation; increasing its damper slightly can help cooling distribution without extra OA beyond what AHU already provides. However, any increase in Z4 flow requires more total flow (fan) or rebalancing others.
  • Z2: 26.6 and CO2 989 rising; we should not reduce its damper. A very small increase can help control both temperature and CO2 without big energy penalty.
  • Z1: 26.2 and CO2 1013 decreasing; moderate cooling and ventilation already. We can slightly reduce its damper to shift some capacity to other zones and reduce flow where both temp and CO2 are already acceptable.

3) Quantitative actuator choices (respecting bounds):
- Coil valve [0.06, 1.0]:
  With all zones a bit warm and OA very hot, we should maintain strong cooling. Given temps are only slightly high and some are already flat/slightly cooling, we keep coil at 0.7 (previous) instead of increasing, to avoid unnecessary chiller energy and the risk of overshoot. This maintains current cooling rate.
  → coil_valve = 0.70 (float, within [0.06, 1.0])

- Fan speed [0.45, 1.4]:
  Fan at 0.7 is moderate. Because we are going to slightly reduce OA fraction, supply air will be cooler per unit flow; we can consider a very small reduction or keep same. However, Z2, Z3, Z4 are warm and we’re not over-ventilating drastically, so to preserve comfort and CO2 control, keep fan where it is to avoid a comfort penalty. Reducing fan now might slow cooling too much while temps are already high in some zones.
  → fan_speed = 0.70 (within [0.45, 1.4])

- OA damper [0.05, 0.6]:
  Current OA = 0.35, outdoor 35.2°C. CO2 is near target and trending down or only slightly up. We can modestly reduce OA to decrease thermal load while still keeping CO2 safely below the violation threshold and close to target, using zone damper adjustments to maintain local CO2.
  A small step from 0.35 to 0.30 should reduce energy without risking fast CO2 increases over 5 minutes.
  → oa_damper = 0.30 (within [0.05, 0.6])

- Zone dampers [0.05, 1.0] (Z1–Z4):
  Start from previous [0.8, 0.65, 1.0, 0.55] and apply targeted tweaks:
  • Zone 1: Slightly warm but close to setpoint (26.2), CO2 1013 trending down. We can reduce its flow a bit to reallocate capacity and cut fan energy, while still keeping acceptable comfort and ventilation. Decrease from 0.8 to 0.7.
    → Z1 damper = 0.70
  • Zone 2: Warmer (26.6) and CO2 989 trending up. Small increase to support temperature pull-down and slow CO2 rise. From 0.65 to 0.7.
    → Z2 damper = 0.70
  • Zone 3: 26.7 and CO2 1014 trending down. It needs good cooling but has maximum damper currently (1.0). Slightly reduce to 0.9 to trim excess flow and fan energy, while keeping strong cooling and ventilation.
    → Z3 damper = 0.90
  • Zone 4: Warmest at 26.9 but low CO2 (877). It needs more cooling but not ventilation limited. Increase damper moderately from 0.55 to 0.65 to improve cooling without maxing flow.
    → Z4 damper = 0.65
  All values remain within [0.05, 1.0].

4) Check against reward components:
- Comfort: Slightly increased cooling emphasis in warmer zones (Z2–Z4) and maintained coil/fan should gently pull temps toward 26°C while keeping them within 25–27°C.
- CO2: OA reduced a bit, but Z2 and Z3 damper choices favor zones closer to/above target. Z1 and Z3 already have decreasing CO2; Z2 is slightly below target with increased damper; Z4 has plenty of margin. Over 5 minutes, CO2 should remain around or under 1000 ppm and well under 1100 ppm, avoiding violation penalties.
- Energy: Slight OA reduction and slight reductions/redistribution in Z1 and Z3 dampers reduce unnecessary flow while keeping comfort, improving reward relative to previous action.

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current state vs objectives:\n- Comfort: All zone temps are within the 25–27°C band but biased a bit warm relative to 26°C center:\n  • Z1: 26.2°C (slightly above center, drifting ~flat)\n  • Z2: 26.6°C (0.6°C high, slowly rising)\n  • Z3: 26.7°C (0.7°C high, ~flat)\n  • Z4: 26.9°C (0.9°C high, slowly rising)\n- CO2 vs 1000 ppm target:\n  • Z1: 1013 ppm, slightly above target but decreasing (-0.7 ppm/min → ~-3.5 over 5 min)\n  • Z2: 989 ppm, slightly below target but increasing (+0.3 ppm/min → ~+1.5)\n  • Z3: 1014 ppm, slightly above target but decreasing (-0.2 ppm/min → ~-1)\n  • Z4: 877 ppm, well below target, slowly increasing (+0.1 ppm/min → ~+0.5)\n  All zones are comfortably below the 1100 ppm violation threshold. Main goal is to stay near/below 1000 without over-ventilating.\n- Outdoor air: Very hot at 35.2°C. Extra OA for CO2 control is expensive thermally.\n- Previous actions:\n  • Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.65, 1.0, 0.55]\n  • OA damper: 0.35\n  • Coil valve: 0.7\n  • Fan speed: 0.7\n  These suggest moderate fan, fairly strong cooling, and relatively open dampers (especially Z3 and Z1) with moderate OA.\n\n2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:\n- Temperatures are on the warm side of the band, so we should maintain or very slightly increase cooling capacity to bring zones closer to 26°C, but not aggressively (to avoid energy penalty and overshoot below 25°C).\n- CO2 is near but not above target. Z1 and Z3 are just above target but already trending down with current OA (0.35) and damper positions. Z2 is slightly below target but trending up; Z4 is well below. There is no need to increase OA; instead, we can slightly reduce OA to cut cooling load and fan energy, while ensuring CO2 does not start trending sharply upward.\n- Zone-by-zone damper adjustments:\n  • Z3: warmest (26.7) and above CO2 target (1014, decreasing). Keep near high position to improve cooling and maintain CO2 decrease, but can very slightly reduce from 1.0 to reduce excessive flow and fan power.\n  • Z4: warmest (26.9) but CO2 is low (877). It needs cooling but not much ventilation; increasing its damper slightly can help cooling distribution without extra OA beyond what AHU already provides. However, any increase in Z4 flow requires more total flow (fan) or rebalancing others.\n  • Z2: 26.6 and CO2 989 rising; we should not reduce its damper. A very small increase can help control both temperature and CO2 without big energy penalty.\n  • Z1: 26.2 and CO2 1013 decreasing; moderate cooling and ventilation already. We can slightly reduce its damper to shift some capacity to other zones and reduce flow where both temp and CO2 are already acceptable.\n\n3) Quantitative actuator choices (respecting bounds):\n- Coil valve [0.06, 1.0]:\n  With all zones a bit warm and OA very hot, we should maintain strong cooling. Given temps are only slightly high and some are already flat/slightly cooling, we keep coil at 0.7 (previous) instead of increasing, to avoid unnecessary chiller energy and the risk of overshoot. This maintains current cooling rate.\n  → coil_valve = 0.70 (float, within [0.06, 1.0])\n\n- Fan speed [0.45, 1.4]:\n  Fan at 0.7 is moderate. Because we are going to slightly reduce OA fraction, supply air will be cooler per unit flow; we can consider a very small reduction or keep same. However, Z2, Z3, Z4 are warm and we’re not over-ventilating drastically, so to preserve comfort and CO2 control, keep fan where it is to avoid a comfort penalty. Reducing fan now might slow cooling too much while temps are already high in some zones.\n  → fan_speed = 0.70 (within [0.45, 1.4])\n\n- OA damper [0.05, 0.6]:\n  Current OA = 0.35, outdoor 35.2°C. CO2 is near target and trending down or only slightly up. We can modestly reduce OA to decrease thermal load while still keeping CO2 safely below the violation threshold and close to target, using zone damper adjustments to maintain local CO2.\n  A small step from 0.35 to 0.30 should reduce energy without risking fast CO2 increases over 5 minutes.\n  → oa_damper = 0.30 (within [0.05, 0.6])\n\n- Zone dampers [0.05, 1.0] (Z1–Z4):\n  Start from previous [0.8, 0.65, 1.0, 0.55] and apply targeted tweaks:\n  • Zone 1: Slightly warm but close to setpoint (26.2), CO2 1013 trending down. We can reduce its flow a bit to reallocate capacity and cut fan energy, while still keeping acceptable comfort and ventilation. Decrease from 0.8 to 0.7.\n    → Z1 damper = 0.70\n  • Zone 2: Warmer (26.6) and CO2 989 trending up. Small increase to support temperature pull-down and slow CO2 rise. From 0.65 to 0.7.\n    → Z2 damper = 0.70\n  • Zone 3: 26.7 and CO2 1014 trending down. It needs good cooling but has maximum damper currently (1.0). Slightly reduce to 0.9 to trim excess flow and fan energy, while keeping strong cooling and ventilation.\n    → Z3 damper = 0.90\n  • Zone 4: Warmest at 26.9 but low CO2 (877). It needs more cooling but not ventilation limited. Increase damper moderately from 0.55 to 0.65 to improve cooling without maxing flow.\n    → Z4 damper = 0.65\n  All values remain within [0.05, 1.0].\n\n4) Check against reward components:\n- Comfort: Slightly increased cooling emphasis in warmer zones (Z2–Z4) and maintained coil/fan should gently pull temps toward 26°C while keeping them within 25–27°C.\n- CO2: OA reduced a bit, but Z2 and Z3 damper choices favor zones closer to/above target. Z1 and Z3 already have decreasing CO2; Z2 is slightly below target with increased damper; Z4 has plenty of margin. Over 5 minutes, CO2 should remain around or under 1000 ppm and well under 1100 ppm, avoiding violation penalties.\n- Energy: Slight OA reduction and slight reductions/redistribution in Z1 and Z3 dampers reduce unnecessary flow while keeping comfort, improving reward relative to previous action.\n\n5) Final clipped actions:\nAll selected values are already within the specified bounds, so no further clipping is needed."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band.
  • Z1: 26.2°C (slightly above 26, flat trend)
  • Z2: 26.6°C (0.6 above setpoint, slightly warming)
  • Z3: 26.7°C (0.7 above, slightly cooling)
  • Z4: 26.8°C (0.8 above, slightly cooling)
  Temperatures are acceptable but a bit on the warm side, especially Z2–Z4.

- CO₂ vs target 1000 ppm (violation threshold 1100 ppm):
  • Z1: 1026 ppm, +2.3 ppm/min → over target and still rising.
  • Z2: 1005 ppm, +3 ppm/min → just over target and rising.
  • Z3: 1009 ppm, −0.7 ppm/min → just over target but decreasing.
  • Z4: 875 ppm, −0.4 ppm/min → well below target and decreasing.
  Main concern: Z1 and Z2 drifting upward above the 1000 ppm target. All zones are well below 1100 ppm, so violation penalty is not imminent but CO₂ penalty weight exists for being over the 1000 ppm target.

- Outdoor air: 34.9°C (very hot) with cooling trend. Using significantly more OA for CO₂ control increases load on the coil and fan.

- Previous actions:
  • Zone dampers: [0.7, 0.7, 0.9, 0.65]
  • OA damper: 0.3 (moderate OA fraction)
  • Coil valve: 0.7 (fairly strong cooling)
  • Fan speed: 0.7 (moderate airflow)
  System is already cooling reasonably hard with moderate OA.

- Reward tradeoffs from design:
  reward = comfort_reward - comfort_penalty * band_penalty - power_weight * power_kw - co2_penalty_weight * co2_penalty - co2_violation_penalty
  Keys:
  • Comfort is already okay; small improvements possible by slightly more cooling, but extra energy may not be worth much if we’re still in band.
  • CO₂: penalty_weight 0.5 is non-trivial; we should try to get Z1 and Z2 trending down toward/below 1000 ppm without large energy spikes.
  • Power: weight 0.2; significant but less than CO₂ violation risk. However, no immediate violation risk, so a moderate increase in OA and fan is justified but large changes would be costly.

2) Strategic decisions for the next 5 minutes:
- CO₂ control approach:
  • To reduce CO₂, increase ventilation effectiveness via OA damper and/or total airflow (fan speed) and distribution (zone dampers).
  • Outdoor CO₂ is assumed lower than indoor; outdoor temperature is high, so excessive OA will increase cooling load. Use a moderate OA increase, not maximum.
  • Z1 and Z2 need priority ventilation; Z3 is already trending down; Z4 is fine and can be slightly deprioritized.

- Temperature control approach:
  • Z2–Z4 are somewhat warm but slowly drifting (Z2 slightly up, Z3–Z4 slightly down). With current coil=0.7 and fan=0.7, they are likely to cool further over the next interval, especially if we slightly increase airflow.
  • Slight boost in cooling plus airflow can help bring temperatures closer to 26°C center without overshooting below 25°C in 5 minutes, given current temps are ≥26.2.

3) Actuator-by-actuator reasoning:
- OA damper (bounds 0.05–0.6, previous 0.3):
  • Need more fresh air to curb CO₂ in Z1 and Z2.
  • Going all the way to 0.6 would sharply increase cooling load with limited extra benefit over a moderate step.
  • A moderate step from 0.3 → ~0.4 should strengthen CO₂ reduction without excessive coil/fan power increase.
  Decision: set oa_damper ≈ 0.4.

- Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4, previous 0.7):
  • Higher fan speed improves both cooling delivery and CO₂ removal, but increases fan power roughly with cube of speed.
  • Current temps are only mildly high; CO₂ is only slightly above target. A small increase is enough.
  • 0.7 → ~0.8 is a modest bump improving ventilation and mixing without a large energy jump.
  Decision: fan_speed ≈ 0.8.

- Coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0, previous 0.7):
  • With hotter OA and slightly warmer zones, more ventilation will increase mixed-air temperature load.
  • We need enough coil to keep supply air cool so that zones don’t warm further and ideally drift slightly downward toward 26°C, but not so much that we risk overcooling below 25°C.
  • Given all zones ≥26.2°C and the short 5-minute horizon, a small increase from 0.7 → ~0.75 supports extra OA and fan while maintaining/strengthening cooling, with modest energy increase.
  Decision: coil_valve ≈ 0.75.

- Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0, previous [0.7, 0.7, 0.9, 0.65]):
  Goal: prioritize Z1 and Z2 (high CO₂ and slightly warm), maintain Z3 (slightly warm but CO₂ decreasing), slightly deprioritize Z4 (CO₂ low, a bit warm but trending down).
  • Zone 1: CO₂ 1026 and rising, temp 26.2 (good). Increase airflow for CO₂ and maintain temp. Raise damper moderately: 0.7 → 0.8.
  • Zone 2: CO₂ 1005 and rising, temp 26.6 and slightly warming. Needs both cooling and ventilation. Increase damper slightly more than Z1: 0.7 → 0.82.
  • Zone 3: CO₂ just above target but decreasing, temp 26.7 and slightly cooling; already at 0.9 damper. Keeping at 0.9 maintains good cooling and dilution without further energy cost at the terminal; upstream fan/coil changes are already accounted for.
  • Zone 4: CO₂ 875 and decreasing, temp 26.8 and slightly cooling. Can afford a small reduction to free capacity for others. Lower slightly: 0.65 → 0.6.
  These are mild adjustments, avoiding aggressive swings that could destabilize comfort.

4) Check against constraints and objectives:
- Bounds:
  • Zone dampers: all in [0.05,1.0].
  • OA damper: 0.4 in [0.05,0.6].
  • Coil valve: 0.75 in [0.06,1.0].
  • Fan speed: 0.8 in [0.45,1.4].
- Expected impact over 5 minutes:
  • CO₂: Increased OA and fan plus higher dampers in Z1/Z2 should flatten then reverse CO₂ rise, reducing penalty without approaching 1100 ppm.
  • Comfort: Slightly more cooling and higher airflow should pull temps for Z2–Z4 gently toward 26°C, likely staying within 25–27°C.
  • Energy: All changes are incremental (0.1–0.15 steps). Some power increase, but aligned with CO₂ and comfort gains, likely improving overall reward.

5) Final chosen actions: apply the moderate, targeted adjustments described above.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.82, 0.9, 0.6], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.75, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Assess current state vs objectives
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps: Z1 26.2 (slightly above center, within band), Z2 26.6, Z3 26.6, Z4 26.8 (all within band but upper half, Z4 closest to upper limit).
- Temp trends: all zones cooling slowly at -0.01°C/min. Over 5 minutes, that’s ~-0.05°C, so expected temps if conditions stay similar:
  - Z1: ~26.15°C
  - Z2: ~26.55°C
  - Z3: ~26.55°C
  - Z4: ~26.75°C
  All remain comfortably inside 25–27°C, but slightly warm-biased, especially Z4.

- CO2: target < 1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm.
  - Z1: 1003 ppm (just above target), trend -4.2 ppm/min → over 5 min ~ -21 ppm → forecast ~982 ppm (back below target).
  - Z2: 989 ppm, trend -3 ppm/min → -15 ppm → ~974 ppm.
  - Z3: 987 ppm, trend -4.2 ppm/min → -21 ppm → ~966 ppm.
  - Z4: 860 ppm, trend -2.8 ppm/min → -14 ppm → ~846 ppm.
  All trending down; only Z1 slightly above 1000 now but will likely be safely below in 5 minutes even if we modestly reduce ventilation.

- Outdoor air: 34.6°C and still hot, though cooling over the hour. Bringing in more OA significantly increases cooling load. So we should avoid increasing OA unless needed for CO2.

- Previous action:
  - Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.82, 0.9, 0.6]
  - OA damper: 0.4 (on a 0.05–0.6 range)
  - Coil valve: 0.75 (strong cooling)
  - Fan speed: 0.8 (on 0.45–1.4 range)
  These settings are relatively aggressive for cooling and ventilation, given that temps are inside the band and CO2 is under control.

2) Strategy to maximise reward
Reward penalises: deviation from comfort center (via comfort_penalty and band_penalty), power use (fan, chiller/pump via coil_valve & fan_speed, more OA), and CO2 (both above target and violations).

Given observations:
- Comfort is acceptable and trending slightly cooler. We can modestly relax cooling to save energy while keeping temps well inside the comfort band, especially watching Z4 (warmest zone).
- CO2 is safe and trending downward; we do NOT need more OA. Mild reduction in OA should still maintain decreasing CO2 given all zones already trending down and close to or below target.
- Power: main levers are coil_valve (chilled water), fan_speed, OA damper (increases required cooling), and zone dampers (affect airflow distribution but also static pressure/fan power indirectly).

Guiding principles for this interval:
- Slightly reduce overall cooling effort (coil_valve) to cut chiller energy while ensuring temperatures do not rise above 27°C in the next 5 minutes.
- Keep fan_speed roughly similar or slightly lower to save fan power, but not so low that comfort drifts upward, especially for the warmest zone.
- Reduce OA damper somewhat (still above minimum) because CO2 is trending down; this will reduce latent/sensible load from hot OA.
- Rebalance zone dampers to favor the warmest zone (Z4) and slightly trim the cooler ones, but make only small adjustments to avoid oscillations.

3) Detailed actuator reasoning
3.1 Coil valve
- Currently 0.75 with slow cooling (-0.01°C/min) while zones are well within band.
- A modest reduction should still keep temps stable or only slightly warmer, since fan and dampers are still generous.
- However, outdoor is very hot; too aggressive a reduction might cause temps, especially Z4, to drift toward 27–27.5°C if load increases slightly.
- Choose a small step down: from 0.75 to 0.7. This should cut some chiller power but keep coil sufficiently cool to maintain or slightly increase cooling rate.

3.2 Fan speed
- Currently 0.8; decreasing fan speed reduces both cooling capacity delivery and ventilation to zones.
- Given OA will be reduced slightly, we don’t want to reduce fan speed too much, particularly to ensure Z4 (warmest) remains comfortable and CO2 decay rates don’t deteriorate significantly.
- Fan power scales roughly with cube of speed; even a small reduction yields savings.
- Choose a slight decrease: from 0.8 to 0.78. This is conservative and should not materially harm comfort or CO2 in 5 minutes.

3.3 OA damper
- Currently 0.4 on [0.05, 0.6]. This is relatively high OA fraction while outdoor is 34.6°C.
- All CO2 values are below 1000 or marginally above but clearly trending downward with the current settings. Even if CO2 decline slows a bit, we are unlikely to approach 1100 ppm in 5 minutes.
- To reduce cooling load, we can reduce OA. But we should avoid large cuts that might reverse CO2 trends.
- Z1 is barely over 1000 ppm now (1003) but projected below 1000 even if OA is somewhat reduced.
- Choose a moderate decrease: from 0.4 to 0.35. That should still provide substantial OA while reducing load.

3.4 Zone dampers
Goals:
- Slightly favor Z4 (warmest at 26.8°C) to maintain or improve its comfort.
- Slightly trim airflow to zones already near center or cooler to reduce unnecessary cooling and fan power.
- Keep changes modest to avoid instability in the control loop.

Current vs target adjustments:
- Z1: 26.2°C and 1003 ppm (just above CO2 target but trending down). We don’t want to starve it of OA too much. Slight reduction is safe but keep relatively high.
  - From 0.8 → 0.78 (small decrease).

- Z2: 26.6°C, 989 ppm. Comfort is fine, CO2 under 1000 and trending down. Can be trimmed a bit more than Z1.
  - From 0.82 → 0.78 (small decrease aligning with Z1; simplifies distribution).

- Z3: 26.6°C, 987 ppm, trending down fast in CO2. Similar situation to Z2. It currently has 0.9 (highest damper), which may be more than necessary.
  - From 0.9 → 0.84 (modest decrease, freeing some capacity for Z4).

- Z4: 26.8°C, warmest, CO2 low (860 ppm). We can safely give it more airflow to improve temperature without CO2 concerns.
  - From 0.6 → 0.65 (small increase to enhance comfort while still moderate).

Net effect:
- Slight reduction in total airflow to already-adequate zones, mild increase to warmest zone.
- Combined with a small fan and coil reduction, we maintain comfort while saving energy.

4) Check against bounds
- zone_dampers must be in [0.05, 1.0]:
  - Z1: 0.78 (valid)
  - Z2: 0.78 (valid)
  - Z3: 0.84 (valid)
  - Z4: 0.65 (valid)
- oa_damper in [0.05, 0.6]: 0.35 (valid)
- coil_valve in [0.06, 1.0]: 0.7 (valid)
- fan_speed in [0.45, 1.4]: 0.78 (valid)

5) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes
- Temperatures: With only slight reductions in cooling power and fan, but improved distribution to warmest zone, temperatures should stay well within 25–27°C, likely hovering around current values or drifting marginally. Z4 may stabilize or cool slightly due to increased airflow.
- CO2: Slightly lower OA and minor fan decrease might slow the downward CO2 trend somewhat, but starting levels and current negative trends strongly suggest all zones will remain below 1000–1050 ppm, far under the 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Energy: Chiller power (coil_valve) and fan power are both reduced a bit, OA load is reduced, improving the energy component of the reward without compromising comfort or IAQ in the short term.

Thus, these setpoints should increase the overall reward for the upcoming 5-minute interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.78, 0.78, 0.84, 0.65], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 0.78}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and state:
- Comfort target 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- All zones are currently within band:
  • Z1: 26.2°C (slightly above setpoint, cooling very slowly: -0.01°C/min)
  • Z2: 26.6°C (0.6°C above, essentially flat)
  • Z3: 26.6°C (0.6°C above, very slow cooling)
  • Z4: 26.8°C (0.8°C above, very slow cooling)
- CO₂:
  • Z1: 997 ppm, decreasing slightly (-1.2 ppm/min) but right at target.
  • Z2: 987 ppm, slowly decreasing.
  • Z3: 978 ppm, decreasing faster.
  • Z4: 852 ppm, healthy margin.
- Outdoor temp 34.4°C (very hot vs 26°C target), decreasing but still much warmer than indoor, so extra outside air costs cooling energy.
- Previous action:
  • Zone dampers: [0.78, 0.78, 0.84, 0.65]
  • OA damper: 0.35
  • Coil valve: 0.70
  • Fan speed: 0.78

We want to: keep temps in band near 26, avoid CO₂ > 1000 (and well below 1100), and reduce energy if we can without sacrificing those.

2) Comfort assessment and needed changes:
- Over next 5 minutes, with current trends:
  • Z1: 26.2 + (-0.01 * 5) ≈ 26.15°C (good, near center).
  • Z2: 26.6 + (0 * 5) ≈ 26.6°C (upper mid-band, mildly warm but acceptable; might allow very slight additional cooling or leave as is).
  • Z3: 26.6 + (-0.01 * 5) ≈ 26.55°C (very mild cooling; still somewhat above center but well within band).
  • Z4: 26.8 + (-0.01 * 5) ≈ 26.75°C (still on the warm side of band but acceptable).
- Zones are comfortable enough; no urgent need to increase cooling. Given high outdoor temperature, we can slightly relax cooling effort to save energy while staying in band.

3) CO₂ assessment:
- Projected 5-minute change:
  • Z1: 997 + (-1.2 * 5) ≈ 991 ppm.
  • Z2: 987 + (-0.6 * 5) ≈ 984 ppm.
  • Z3: 978 + (-1.8 * 5) ≈ 969 ppm.
  • Z4: 852 + (-1.5 * 5) ≈ 845 ppm.
- Even with slightly less ventilation, the near-term risk of exceeding 1000 ppm is very low. Z1 is the tightest, but trending down. Thus we can moderately reduce OA and fan to cut energy, without likely CO₂ violation in the next interval.

4) Energy levers and trade-offs:
- Fan_speed and coil_valve are the largest system-wide energy drivers.
- OA_damper controls outside air fraction; with 34.4°C outside, more OA => more coil load and fan power.
- Zone dampers allocate airflow distribution and also influence total VAV flow (in practice with static pressure control). Here, we treat them mostly as comfort distribution levers; modest changes are safer to avoid big transients.

5) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Coil valve: Slightly decrease from 0.70 to reduce chiller energy while ensuring zones don’t drift warm too quickly. Given current temps within band and negative/flat trends, a modest reduction to about 0.65 balances comfort and energy.
- Fan speed: Reduce somewhat to cut fan power but keep enough flow to maintain CO₂ decline and temperature control. From 0.78 down to around 0.72 is a conservative step; we don’t want a big drop because Z4 is still near 27°C and Z1 CO₂ is just under 1000.
- OA damper: Because all CO₂ levels are below 1000 and trending down, we can reduce OA to save cooling energy. However, Z1 is close to 1000, so avoid an aggressive cut. From 0.35 to about 0.30 keeps decent ventilation while reducing hot outside air load.
- Zone dampers: Keep overall pattern similar, but we can slightly reallocate to support the warmest zones (Z2–Z4) while very slightly trimming the cooler/ventilated ones if needed.
  • Z1 is near setpoint temp and highest CO₂; we should not reduce its airflow (for CO₂ control), and we don’t need more cooling. Keep damper about the same.
  • Z2 and Z3 are a bit warm; modest boost or maintain to avoid them drifting warmer as we reduce coil/fan.
  • Z4 is warmest; small increase for extra cooling/ventilation.
- To avoid overcomplicating and to maintain stable operation, adjust zone dampers only slightly:
  • Z1: keep at 0.78.
  • Z2: keep at 0.78 (already moderate-high).
  • Z3: currently 0.84; keep there, as it’s already prioritized.
  • Z4: increase a bit from 0.65 to 0.70 to help the warmest zone.

6) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers: proposed [0.78, 0.78, 0.84, 0.70] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.30 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.65 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.72 within [0.45, 1.4].

7) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Slightly reduced cooling and air volume will marginally slow the temperature decrease; zones should remain well within 25–27°C, likely hovering about where they are or drifting very slightly warmer but still inside band.
- CO₂ should continue to trend downward or at worst flatten a bit, staying clearly below 1000 ppm in all zones; peak CO₂ well below 1100, so no violation penalty.

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Objectives and state:\n- Comfort target 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.\n- All zones are currently within band:\n  • Z1: 26.2°C (slightly above setpoint, cooling very slowly: -0.01°C/min)\n  • Z2: 26.6°C (0.6°C above, essentially flat)\n  • Z3: 26.6°C (0.6°C above, very slow cooling)\n  • Z4: 26.8°C (0.8°C above, very slow cooling)\n- CO₂:\n  • Z1: 997 ppm, decreasing slightly (-1.2 ppm/min) but right at target.\n  • Z2: 987 ppm, slowly decreasing.\n  • Z3: 978 ppm, decreasing faster.\n  • Z4: 852 ppm, healthy margin.\n- Outdoor temp 34.4°C (very hot vs 26°C target), decreasing but still much warmer than indoor, so extra outside air costs cooling energy.\n- Previous action:\n  • Zone dampers: [0.78, 0.78, 0.84, 0.65]\n  • OA damper: 0.35\n  • Coil valve: 0.70\n  • Fan speed: 0.78\n\nWe want to: keep temps in band near 26, avoid CO₂ > 1000 (and well below 1100), and reduce energy if we can without sacrificing those.\n\n2) Comfort assessment and needed changes:\n- Over next 5 minutes, with current trends:\n  • Z1: 26.2 + (-0.01 * 5) ≈ 26.15°C (good, near center).\n  • Z2: 26.6 + (0 * 5) ≈ 26.6°C (upper mid-band, mildly warm but acceptable; might allow very slight additional cooling or leave as is).\n  • Z3: 26.6 + (-0.01 * 5) ≈ 26.55°C (very mild cooling; still somewhat above center but well within band).\n  • Z4: 26.8 + (-0.01 * 5) ≈ 26.75°C (still on the warm side of band but acceptable).\n- Zones are comfortable enough; no urgent need to increase cooling. Given high outdoor temperature, we can slightly relax cooling effort to save energy while staying in band.\n\n3) CO₂ assessment:\n- Projected 5-minute change:\n  • Z1: 997 + (-1.2 * 5) ≈ 991 ppm.\n  • Z2: 987 + (-0.6 * 5) ≈ 984 ppm.\n  • Z3: 978 + (-1.8 * 5) ≈ 969 ppm.\n  • Z4: 852 + (-1.5 * 5) ≈ 845 ppm.\n- Even with slightly less ventilation, the near-term risk of exceeding 1000 ppm is very low. Z1 is the tightest, but trending down. Thus we can moderately reduce OA and fan to cut energy, without likely CO₂ violation in the next interval.\n\n4) Energy levers and trade-offs:\n- Fan_speed and coil_valve are the largest system-wide energy drivers.\n- OA_damper controls outside air fraction; with 34.4°C outside, more OA => more coil load and fan power.\n- Zone dampers allocate airflow distribution and also influence total VAV flow (in practice with static pressure control). Here, we treat them mostly as comfort distribution levers; modest changes are safer to avoid big transients.\n\n5) Strategy for next 5 minutes:\n- Coil valve: Slightly decrease from 0.70 to reduce chiller energy while ensuring zones don’t drift warm too quickly. Given current temps within band and negative/flat trends, a modest reduction to about 0.65 balances comfort and energy.\n- Fan speed: Reduce somewhat to cut fan power but keep enough flow to maintain CO₂ decline and temperature control. From 0.78 down to around 0.72 is a conservative step; we don’t want a big drop because Z4 is still near 27°C and Z1 CO₂ is just under 1000.\n- OA damper: Because all CO₂ levels are below 1000 and trending down, we can reduce OA to save cooling energy. However, Z1 is close to 1000, so avoid an aggressive cut. From 0.35 to about 0.30 keeps decent ventilation while reducing hot outside air load.\n- Zone dampers: Keep overall pattern similar, but we can slightly reallocate to support the warmest zones (Z2–Z4) while very slightly trimming the cooler/ventilated ones if needed.\n  • Z1 is near setpoint temp and highest CO₂; we should not reduce its airflow (for CO₂ control), and we don’t need more cooling. Keep damper about the same.\n  • Z2 and Z3 are a bit warm; modest boost or maintain to avoid them drifting warmer as we reduce coil/fan.\n  • Z4 is warmest; small increase for extra cooling/ventilation.\n- To avoid overcomplicating and to maintain stable operation, adjust zone dampers only slightly:\n  • Z1: keep at 0.78.\n  • Z2: keep at 0.78 (already moderate-high).\n  • Z3: currently 0.84; keep there, as it’s already prioritized.\n  • Z4: increase a bit from 0.65 to 0.70 to help the warmest zone.\n\n6) Bounds check:\n- Zone dampers: proposed [0.78, 0.78, 0.84, 0.70] all within [0.05, 1.0].\n- OA damper: 0.30 within [0.05, 0.6].\n- Coil valve: 0.65 within [0.06, 1.0].\n- Fan speed: 0.72 within [0.45, 1.4].\n\n7) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:\n- Slightly reduced cooling and air volume will marginally slow the temperature decrease; zones should remain well within 25–27°C, likely hovering about where they are or drifting very slightly warmer but still inside band.\n- CO₂ should continue to trend downward or at worst flatten a bit, staying clearly below 1000 ppm in all zones; peak CO₂ well below 1100, so no violation penalty.\n- Fan and chiller energy both reduced relative to previous step, improving reward given comfort and CO₂ are maintained.\n\nThus, the following setpoints are chosen as a moderate energy-saving adjustment while preserving comfort and air quality."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band and close to the 26°C center:
  - Z1: 26.2°C (slightly above setpoint, essentially flat trend)
  - Z2: 26.6°C (warm side, trend ~0)
  - Z3: 26.5°C (warm side, slightly cooling at -0.01°C/min ≈ -0.05°C over 5 min)
  - Z4: 26.7°C (warmest, slightly cooling at -0.01°C/min)
  Overall: mild cooling still useful, but no aggressive action needed.

- CO2: Near but around the 1000 ppm target; one zone already above target:
  - Z1: 1006 ppm, rising +1.7 ppm/min ⇒ +8.5 ppm in 5 min → ~1014 ppm
  - Z2: 996 ppm, rising +1.8 ppm/min ⇒ +9 ppm → ~1005 ppm
  - Z3: 981 ppm, rising +0.7 ppm/min ⇒ +3.5 ppm → ~985 ppm
  - Z4: 852 ppm, flat
  All zones are below the violation threshold (1100 ppm), but two will be a bit above the 1000 ppm target if we keep ventilation exactly as is. We want to nudge ventilation up slightly to reduce CO2 penalties and keep margin to 1100 ppm, balancing energy.

- Outdoor air: 34.1°C, much hotter than indoor (~26.2–26.7°C), though trending cooler. Bringing in more OA significantly increases sensible cooling load; so any OA increase must be modest and paired with adequate cooling.

- Previous action:
  - zone_dampers: [0.78, 0.78, 0.84, 0.70]
  - oa_damper: 0.30
  - coil_valve: 0.65
  - fan_speed: 0.72
  These represent moderately open VAV dampers, moderate OA fraction, moderate cooling, and moderate fan speed.

2) Objectives and trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- Comfort: keep all zones near 26°C without overshooting below 25°C. With outdoor at 34.1°C, the dominant load is likely cooling; zones are currently on the warm side and nearly steady, so we should maintain or slightly increase effective cooling to gently bring them closer to 26°C center, but avoid aggressive coil/fan increases that would waste energy.
- CO2: Z1 is already above 1000 ppm; Z2 will likely cross 1000 ppm soon. We should slightly increase ventilation to reduce the rate of CO2 rise or start lowering it, but because OA is hot, we cannot increase OA damper too much without energy penalties.
- Energy: reward includes a power term; we want minimal increases in fan and coil. Adjusting zone dampers (distribution) is lower-impact than large fan/coils changes.

3) Strategy by actuator:

3.1) Outdoor air damper (bounds 0.05–0.60, currently 0.30):
- We want slightly more ventilation to address CO2 in Z1 and Z2, but outdoor is hot, so OA increase raises cooling load.
- A small step up, not large, should help CO2 without a big energy penalty.
- Move from 0.30 to ~0.35 (within [0.05, 0.60]). This modest 0.05 increase gives more fresh air in the next 5 min while controlling energy impact.

3.2) Coil valve (cooling capacity, bounds 0.06–1.0, currently 0.65):
- Zones are warm (26.2–26.7°C) and mostly flat/slightly decreasing. Increasing OA with hot air will increase mixed-air temperature, so we need at least maintain current coil to avoid further warming.
- Slightly increasing coil opening offsets the hotter mixed air and can nudge zones toward 26.0°C without risk of dropping below 25°C in 5 min.
- A small increase from 0.65 to ~0.68 balances comfort and energy (not a huge energy jump).

3.3) Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.40, currently 0.72):
- More airflow improves both cooling delivery and CO2 dilution (through increased total supply), but increases fan power (typically cubic relationship).
- Given CO2 is only slightly above target and temperatures are near setpoint, we avoid a large fan increase; a tiny bump can help distribute increased OA and cooling better.
- Move from 0.72 to ~0.74: small increase, modest energy cost, slightly better ventilation/cooling.

3.4) Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0 each):
- Goal: prioritize more airflow to zones with higher temp error and higher CO2, without significantly increasing total flow (we’re already increasing fan slightly).
- Zones analysis:
  - Z1: 26.2°C (small temp error), but highest CO2 (1006 ppm and rising). Needs more ventilation for CO2, but temperature is fine. Still, higher flow can cool it slightly below 26°C if coil is strong; we need to keep increase modest.
  - Z2: 26.6°C, near-highest temp error and high CO2. Good candidate for extra flow.
  - Z3: 26.5°C, slightly warm, moderate CO2. Slightly above target but less urgent.
  - Z4: 26.7°C, warmest but low CO2; cooling need is relatively high, but not CO2-driven.

- Approach: slightly re-balance instead of globally opening more. We’ve already increased fan and OA, so we can bias distribution rather than absolute total:
  - Z1: small increase for CO2, from 0.78 → 0.80.
  - Z2: increase for both temp and CO2, from 0.78 → 0.82.
  - Z3: almost okay; keep roughly the same, maybe marginally down to help Z1/Z2 share more of the increased fan flow; from 0.84 → 0.83.
  - Z4: warm but low CO2; keep same or very slightly up. Because Z4 is warmest, we should not reduce it. A tiny bump from 0.70 → 0.72 should help comfort without too much added flow.
- All these remain within [0.05, 1.0]. Overall average damper position changes only slightly, so the main flow increase is via fan_speed, not dampers, limiting energy penalty.

4) Check constraints and expected outcome:
- Bounds:
  - zone_dampers: chosen values all within [0.05, 1.0].
  - oa_damper: 0.35 within [0.05, 0.60].
  - coil_valve: 0.68 within [0.06, 1.0].
  - fan_speed: 0.74 within [0.45, 1.40]. No clipping required.

- Expected over next 5 minutes:
  - Temperatures: Slight increase in cooling capacity and distribution should slowly pull warm zones closer to 26°C center while keeping all comfortably above 25°C. Outdoor is still hot, but we counter it with slightly higher coil.
  - CO2: Higher OA fraction and a bit more airflow, especially in Z1 and Z2, should reduce or flatten their CO2 rise, reducing co2_penalty and maintaining margin from 1100 ppm.
  - Energy: Fan and coil changes are modest; OA increase is small. This balances improved comfort/CO2 with only a mild increase in energy use, likely improving net reward.

5) Final decision: Apply the small, targeted adjustments as described, already clipped to bounds.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.82, 0.83, 0.72], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.68, ""fan_speed"": 0.74}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- All zone temps: Z1=26.1, Z2=26.6, Z3=26.5, Z4=26.7. All within 25–27°C; Z2–Z4 slightly warm but well within band.
- Temperature trends are effectively flat (≈0°C/min), so current cooling is roughly balancing gains.
- CO2: Z1=1002 ppm (>1000 target but trending down -0.7/min), Z2=994, Z3=978, Z4=845. All comfortably below 1100 ppm violation threshold. Existing dilution seems adequate.
- Outdoor air: 34°C, much hotter than indoors, so extra OA increases cooling load and fan power.
- Previous actions: zone dampers fairly open (0.72–0.83), OA damper 0.35, coil valve 0.68, fan 0.74. System is providing substantial cooling and airflow.

2) Reward considerations:
- Comfort: already inside comfort band; overly aggressive changes risk drifting some zones too cool or too warm. With comfort_sigma=0.25, large temp deviations are heavily penalized, so gentle adjustments are preferable.
- CO2: only slightly above target in Zone 1 and trending down. Since violation penalty only triggers above 1100 ppm, and trends are negative, we can afford to slightly reduce OA and/or fan without risking a violation.
- Power: energy cost is directly penalized (power_weight=0.2). Fan speed and coil_valve (chilled water / compressor load) dominate electricity. Reducing these while staying in band and below CO2 limits will improve reward.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Maintain temperatures within ~25.8–26.6°C over the interval while slightly easing energy usage.
- Moderately reduce fan speed to cut fan and chiller load (lower airflow reduces sensible load on coil).
- Slightly reduce coil_valve to reduce chiller energy; given temps are stable and slightly above setpoint, we should not cut too aggressively or zones may slowly warm.
- Slightly trim OA damper to reduce hot outside air load while keeping enough fresh air to maintain declining CO2 trend.
- Keep zone dampers mostly as-is for now; they are already open enough that reducing them may cause localized warming and comfort penalties. Since we’re reducing fan speed, leaving zone dampers high helps sustain zone flows without needing higher fan.

4) Quantitative adjustments:
- Fan speed: currently 0.74. Temps are stable and within band; CO2 is falling. Reduce a bit to 0.70 (within [0.45, 1.4]). This lowers fan power without a big comfort hit over 5 minutes.
- Coil valve: currently 0.68. Outdoor is hot and several zones are slightly warm (26.5–26.7). To avoid warming drift, only a mild reduction: to 0.65. This trims chiller load but keeps significant cooling capacity.
- OA damper: currently 0.35. CO2 is already trending down and max is only ~1000 ppm. Reduce modestly to 0.30 to cut thermal load from 34°C air while keeping adequate ventilation.
- Zone dampers: leave nearly unchanged to maintain zone airflow balance under lower fan speed. If anything, we might slightly reduce a bit in cooler zone (Z1=26.1) and keep higher in warmer zones, but differences are small, and complexity could risk greater imbalance. To favor energy savings with minimal comfort risk, we’ll keep them constant for this step.

5) Check bounds and finalize:
- Zone dampers: remain [0.8, 0.82, 0.83, 0.72] (all within [0.05, 1.0]).
- OA damper: 0.30 (within [0.05, 0.6]).
- Coil valve: 0.65 (within [0.06, 1.0]).
- Fan speed: 0.70 (within [0.45, 1.4]).

6) Expected outcome next 5 minutes:
- Slightly lower total airflow and coil capacity; with current temps near target and trends flat, temperatures may drift up by only a few tenths at most, staying well within 25–27°C.
- CO2 should remain below 1000–1020 ppm in worst case and below 1100 ppm violation threshold, given existing downward trends and only modest OA reduction.
- Fan and chiller energy use are reduced, improving the power component of the reward while keeping comfort and CO2 in acceptable ranges.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.82, 0.83, 0.72], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.65, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps: Z1=26.1, Z2=26.6, Z3=26.5, Z4=26.6°C. All within band; Z2–4 slightly warm but still acceptable.
- Temp trends are ~0 or slightly negative ⇒ temperatures are stable/not rising.
- CO2: Z1=1011 ppm, Z2=1003 ppm, Z3=984 ppm, Z4=847 ppm.
  • Z1 and Z2 are already above the 1000 ppm target and trending up.
  • Z3 is just below target but increasing.
  • Z4 is comfortable and relatively low CO2.
- Outdoor air: 34°C, hotter than zones ⇒ more OA increases cooling load and may warm coils slightly if not offset by more valve/fan.
- Previous action: zone_dampers ~0.72–0.83, oa_damper=0.30, coil_valve=0.65, fan_speed=0.70. CO2 is still creeping up in critical zones despite moderate OA and airflow.

2) Main tradeoffs for next 5 minutes:
- CO2 is the most immediate concern: Z1 and Z2 are already above 1000 ppm and still drifting upward; Z3 will likely cross 1000 shortly. We want to avoid hitting 1100 ppm (big violation penalty) and reduce the CO2 penalty.
- Temperatures are within band, only mildly warm; we can afford a bit more cooling and airflow if needed.
- Increasing OA and fan speed raises energy use; increasing coil valve raises chiller/pump energy. But given the penalty structure, staying within CO2/comfort constraints is more valuable than a small energy saving over 5 minutes.

3) Strategy for this interval:
- Ventilation: modest but clear increase in OA damper to slow and ideally reverse CO2 rise, balancing energy use against CO2 penalties.
  • Prior oa_damper=0.30. CO2 is still climbing, especially in Z1/Z2.
  • Increase OA to 0.40 to significantly improve ventilation without going to the 0.60 max, which would be energy-heavy with 34°C outside.
- Fan speed: higher fan speed improves both cooling delivery and CO2 dilution (more total supply flow and OA volume). Current 0.70.
  • Increase moderately to 0.80 to boost ventilation/cooling while avoiding large power jump toward 1.4.
- Coil valve: outdoor is hot; increasing OA will warm mixed air slightly, so we need slightly more cooling to prevent zones from drifting above 27°C, especially Z2/Z4 already at 26.6°C.
  • Current coil_valve=0.65 with temps roughly steady.
  • Increase slightly to 0.70 to counteract additional OA and nudge temps a bit cooler, staying around 26°C.
- Zone dampers: use them to prioritize high-CO2 zones while slightly easing flow to low-CO2 one:
  • Z1 (1011 ppm) and Z2 (1003 ppm): highest priority. Slightly open further vs. previous to increase ventilation.
    - Z1: from 0.80 → 0.86
    - Z2: from 0.82 → 0.88
  • Z3 (984 ppm, rising): near target; keep similar or slightly higher than before to avoid crossing 1000 too much.
    - Z3: from 0.83 → 0.87 (slight increase, but keep it close to Z1/Z2 priority band)
  • Z4 (847 ppm, lower CO2, slightly warm but acceptable): can slightly reduce its damper versus others to redistribute some flow/ventilation.
    - Z4: from 0.72 → 0.68 (still high, just modest reduction)

4) Check constraints and clipping:
- Zone dampers bounds: [0.05, 1.0]. All proposed: [0.86, 0.88, 0.87, 0.68] are within 0.05–1.0 ⇒ no clipping.
- OA damper bounds: [0.05, 0.6]. Proposed 0.40 ⇒ within bounds.
- Coil valve bounds: [0.06, 1.0]. Proposed 0.70 ⇒ within bounds.
- Fan speed bounds: [0.45, 1.4]. Proposed 0.80 ⇒ within bounds.

5) Expected effect on reward:
- Comfort_reward: Temps likely stay in or move slightly toward center of comfort band due to modest extra cooling.
- Comfort_penalty: minimal since all zones are within band and not likely to overshoot cold due to modest adjustments.
- CO2_penalty: should decrease or at least stop worsening as increased OA + fan + prioritized dampers improve ventilation, especially for Z1 and Z2.
- CO2_violation_penalty: reduced risk of any zone hitting 1100 ppm in the next 5 minutes.
- Power_weight term increases from higher fan, OA, and coil, but this is likely outweighed by improved comfort/CO2 terms.

Thus, this set of actions is a balanced move: stronger focus on CO2 and comfort, modest energy increase.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.86, 0.88, 0.87, 0.68], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

  • Z1: 990 ppm, trending down -3.9 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ 970 ppm
  • Z2: 985 ppm, -3.3 ppm/min → ≈ 968 ppm
  • Z3: 968 ppm, -3.0 ppm/min → ≈ 953 ppm
  • Z4: 835 ppm, -2.3 ppm/min → ≈ 824 ppm
  So CO2 is under target and falling; risk of exceeding 1000 ppm or 1100 ppm in next 5 min is very low.
- Outdoor: 34.1°C, hotter than indoors (~26–27°C). More outdoor air increases sensible load and chiller/pump/fan energy.
- Previous actions: relatively high cooling and airflow:
  • zone_dampers: [0.86, 0.88, 0.87, 0.68]
  • oa_damper: 0.4 (on a 0.05–0.6 range)
  • coil_valve: 0.7 (strong cooling)
  • fan_speed: 0.8 (moderately high)

2) Reward trade-offs:
- Comfort: Already good and trending slightly cooler in all zones. We must avoid overcooling below 25°C over time, but in a 5-minute horizon, with only -0.01°C/min and given we will reduce cooling now, risk is minimal.
- CO2: Already below target and trending down. We can slightly reduce ventilation (OA damper) without risking going above 1000 ppm soon. That reduces load/energy and improves reward via lower power_kw.
- Power: Fan_speed, coil_valve, and higher OA damper all drive power consumption. Since comfort and CO2 are fine, we can step these down to save energy while staying in band.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Coil_valve: Reduce cooling somewhat, but not too much, to avoid temps creeping up toward 27°C over more than one interval. Because temps are mid-band and drifting downward slightly, we can cut coil from 0.7 to about 0.5; this should reduce chiller energy yet maintain enough cooling given high outdoor temperature and reasonably high airflow.
- Fan_speed: Lower fan speed from 0.8 to around 0.65. This reduces fan power substantially while still providing significant airflow for both cooling and ventilation within each zone. Since CO2 is already trending down, a slight reduction in flow is acceptable.
- OA damper: Because outdoor air is much hotter than zones and current CO2 is safe and decreasing, we can reduce OA damper toward a more minimum-ventilation level while not going to the absolute minimum. From 0.4 down to about 0.25 is a balanced move: still provides substantial outdoor air but cuts unnecessary load and fan energy.
- Zone dampers:
  • Zones 1–3 have similar temps and CO2 near the top end; Zone 4 is slightly warmer (26.6°C) but with much lower CO2.
  • Goal: maintain or slightly favor cooling/ventilation to warmer zones (Z2–Z4), while shaving some flow to the most comfortable/cooler zone.
  • However, all zones are within 0.5°C of each other and CO2 deltas are all negative; large rebalancing is not needed.
  • Starting from [0.86, 0.88, 0.87, 0.68], I will modestly: 
    - Slightly decrease Z1 damper (most comfortable and highest CO2, but already decreasing and only 990 ppm) from 0.86 to 0.80.
    - Keep Z2 and Z3 high but trim slightly to reflect reduced overall load and lower fan speed, say Z2: 0.85 (was 0.88), Z3: 0.84 (was 0.87).
    - Slightly increase Z4 (warmest zone) from 0.68 to 0.72 to maintain comfort parity as we drop fan and coil overall.
  This keeps relative prioritization: Z4 gets a bit more, Z2/Z3 remain high, Z1 is slightly de-emphasized but still well ventilated.

4) Constraints and clipping:
- zone_dampers bounds: [0.05, 1.0] → all proposed values [0.80, 0.85, 0.84, 0.72] are within bounds.
- oa_damper bounds: [0.05, 0.6] → proposed 0.25 is within bounds.
- coil_valve bounds: [0.06, 1.0] → proposed 0.5 is within bounds.
- fan_speed bounds: [0.45, 1.4] → proposed 0.65 is within bounds.

5) Expected outcomes over next 5 min:
- Temperatures: With reduced coil and fan, the small cooling trend (-0.01°C/min) may flatten, but current temps are mid-band. Over 5 minutes, changes are small; comfort remains high and well within 25–27°C.
- CO2: Slightly lower airflow and OA damper may slightly reduce the rate of CO2 decrease, but starting near or below 1000 ppm and already trending downward, they should remain safely below both 1000 and 1100 ppm.
- Power: Lower coil_valve, OA damper, and fan_speed significantly reduce energy, improving reward given the power_weight.

Thus the chosen action balances maintaining comfort and CO2 while reducing energy to maximize the stated reward for the next interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.85, 0.84, 0.72], ""oa_damper"": 0.25, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and temperature assessment:
- All zones are within the comfort band (25–27°C):
  • Z1: 26.1°C (near center, slight positive error 0.1)
  • Z2: 26.5°C (0.5 above setpoint, but well within band)
  • Z3: 26.4°C (0.4 above setpoint)
  • Z4: 26.5°C (0.5 above setpoint)
- Temperature trends per minute are ~0 (very stable). With only 5 minutes ahead, we can make modest adjustments without risking leaving the 25–27°C band.
- Outdoor temperature is very hot (34.1°C, trending up). This means:
  • Any increase in OA fraction will raise cooling load.
  • Reducing cooling aggressively could allow temps to drift up, but the current deltas are tiny, so a moderate reduction in cooling should keep comfort within band.

2) CO2 assessment and risk:
- Z1: 1013 ppm, rising at +4.3 ppm/min → in 5 min: ≈ 1034 ppm.
- Z2: 1004 ppm, rising at +3.7 ppm/min → ≈ 1023 ppm.
- Z3: 984 ppm, rising at +3.1 ppm/min → ≈ 999 ppm.
- Z4: 844 ppm, rising at +1.9 ppm/min → ≈ 854 ppm.
- Targets:
  • Penalty target: 1000 ppm.
  • Hard violation: 1100 ppm.
- Z1 and Z2 are already above 1000 and rising; Z3 will touch ~1000. None will reach 1100 in this 5-min interval, but CO2 penalties will increase if we don’t improve ventilation.

3) Trade-offs for reward:
- Reward = comfort_reward - 2*band_penalty - 0.2*power_kw - 0.5*co2_penalty - co2_violation_penalty.
- Main levers:
  • Zone dampers: affect per-zone airflow and local CO2 washout & sensible cooling.
  • OA damper: affects outside air fraction → CO2 reduction vs. added cooling load.
  • Coil valve: affects supply air temperature → more/less cooling.
  • Fan speed: affects total airflow → power up roughly ~speed^n (n>1), but also helps CO2 and temperature control.
- Given all zones are comfortable and almost flat in temperature, we can slightly reduce cooling/power while modestly increasing ventilation to counter CO2.

4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Objectives in order:
  1) Avoid CO2 trending much higher above 1000 ppm, especially in Zones 1 and 2.
  2) Keep all temps within 25–27°C, as close to 26°C as possible, but some slight upward drift is acceptable to save energy.
  3) Avoid big power increases; only modest adjustments to OA/fan.

5) Actuator-by-actuator reasoning:

a) OA damper (current 0.25, bounds 0.05–0.6):
- Increasing OA directly helps CO2 but increases cooling load since outdoor air is 34.1°C.
- CO2 is already >1000 in Z1/Z2 and rising; not near 1100 but we want to slow growth.
- A moderate increase (e.g., to ~0.32–0.35) will improve CO2 without a large power hit.
- Choose OA damper = 0.33 (modest increase, still well below max 0.6).

b) Zone dampers (current: [0.8, 0.85, 0.84, 0.72], bounds 0.05–1.0):
- Zones with highest CO2: Z1 and Z2 → prioritize more airflow there.
- Z1 temp is near setpoint (26.1), Z2 a bit warmer (26.5). Extra airflow will slightly cool them (which is acceptable) and improve CO2.
- Z3 is near 1000 ppm; Z4 is much lower.
- Adjustments:
  • Zone 1: slightly up from 0.8 to 0.85 to address CO2.
  • Zone 2: slightly up from 0.85 to 0.9; it's warmest and high CO2.
  • Zone 3: keep about the same, maybe tiny up for CO2 but limit power: from 0.84 to 0.86.
  • Zone 4: lowest CO2 and acceptable temp; can slightly reduce airflow to shift capacity to other zones and save a bit of fan/coil load: from 0.72 down to 0.68.
- These are small relative changes that should not destabilize temps in 5 minutes.

c) Coil valve (current 0.5, bounds 0.06–1.0):
- All zones are slightly on the warm side of setpoint but safely within comfort band and temp trends are flat.
- OA increase and slightly higher zone flows will increase coil load; to balance energy, we can hold or slightly reduce coil since we don’t want to overcool.
- However, outdoor is very hot; reducing too much might start warming zones above 27°C in later intervals. For this 5-min period, a small reduction is low-risk given almost zero positive temp trend now.
- Choose coil valve = 0.45 (small reduction from 0.5, reduces chiller/pump energy while likely keeping temps near 26–26.6°C).

d) Fan speed (current 0.65, bounds 0.45–1.4):
- Higher fan speed improves CO2 distribution and cooling but increases fan power.
- We already increased OA and some zone dampers; that should improve CO2. To avoid compounding power, keep fan speed constant.
- Keeping fan_speed = 0.65 balances CO2 benefit from damper changes with energy cost.

6) Safety and bounds check:
- zone_dampers: [0.85, 0.9, 0.86, 0.68] → all in [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.33 → in [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve: 0.45 → in [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.65 → in [0.45, 1.4].

7) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- CO2 in Z1/Z2 should rise more slowly or potentially stabilize/slightly decrease compared to prior trend due to more OA and zone flow.
- Temps may cool slightly in Z1/Z2/Z3 from increased air, but reduced coil valve should counteract that, keeping all zones within 25–27°C.
- Energy: modest OA increase and slightly higher airflow in some zones offset by lower coil valve and unchanged fan speed → likely a good compromise for reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.9, 0.86, 0.68], ""oa_damper"": 0.33, ""coil_valve"": 0.45, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current conditions:
- Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C band and close to the 26°C target.
  • Z1: 26.1°C (slightly above setpoint, small positive error, slow warming 0.01°C/min).
  • Z2: 26.6°C (0.6°C above setpoint, also warming slowly).
  • Z3: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint, warming slowly).
  • Z4: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint, stable temp).
  The building is trending slightly warmer with time, so some cooling is still needed.

- CO2:
  • Z1: 1019 ppm, rising 1.2 ppm/min.
  • Z2: 1010 ppm, rising 1.1 ppm/min.
  • Z3: 989 ppm, rising 1.0 ppm/min.
  • Z4: 845 ppm, rising 0.3 ppm/min.
  The target is 1000 ppm and violation at 1100 ppm. Z1 and Z2 are already above 1000 ppm and still increasing; Z3 is just below target and rising; Z4 is well below.
  Over the next 5 minutes, if trends persisted with no change:
  • Z1: 1019 + 1.2*5 ≈ 1025 ppm (further above target but below violation).
  • Z2: 1010 + 1.1*5 ≈ 1016 ppm.
  • Z3: 989 + 1.0*5 ≈ 994 ppm.
  • Z4: 845 + 0.3*5 ≈ 846.5 ppm.
  So there is growing CO2 penalty in Z1 and Z2; we should increase ventilation somewhat, especially for those zones, without excessive energy use.

- Outdoor conditions: 34°C (hotter than indoors), slowly cooling over the hour but still far above indoor temps. This means:
  • Increasing outdoor air will increase sensible heat load, so we should not open OA damper too much—just enough to control CO2.
  • Cooling coil must compensate for both internal loads and ventilation load.

- Previous action:
  • Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.9, 0.86, 0.68] (already quite open, especially in Z1–Z3).
  • OA damper: 0.33 (moderate outdoor air fraction).
  • Coil valve: 0.45 (moderate cooling capacity).
  • Fan speed: 0.65 (moderate airflow).
  Comfort is acceptable but slightly warm while CO2 in two zones is above target. So we likely need modest increases in ventilation effectiveness and cooling, not reductions.

2) Objectives trade-off (reward structure):
- Reward = comfort_reward - 2.0*band_penalty - 0.2*power_kw - 0.5*co2_penalty - co2_violation_penalty.
- Key priorities given current state:
  • Avoid CO2 violation (1100 ppm) – currently safe but trending upward in some zones.
  • Reduce CO2_penalty by pulling Z1 and Z2 back toward/below 1000 ppm over time.
  • Maintain comfort near 26°C within 25–27°C band while minimizing energy.
- Because Z1–Z2 CO2 are above target, a small increase in ventilation is justified even if it costs some energy. However, OA air is very hot, so we should preferably boost zone airflow and slightly OA damper, and ensure coil can handle the extra load, rather than opening OA excessively.

3) Control strategy for next 5-minute interval:
- Zone dampers:
  • Z1, Z2, Z3 are all slightly warm and have highest CO2. Keeping them quite open will:
    - Help deliver more cool, relatively low-CO2 supply air (assuming central dilution).
    - Improve both temperature and CO2.
  • Z4 is warm but has low CO2; it doesn’t need as much ventilation for IAQ, but it still needs cooling. However, we can keep its damper a bit lower relative to Z1–Z3 to prioritize airflow to high-CO2 zones when fan speed increases.
  • To control energy, we avoid maxing all dampers to 1.0; we instead make modest increases where CO2 is worst.
  Proposed adjustments from previous:
  • Z1: 0.85 → 0.90 (slight increase to address its highest CO2 and light warmth).
  • Z2: 0.90 → 0.92 (it’s similarly high CO2 and warmer than setpoint; give it slightly more than Z1).
  • Z3: 0.86 → 0.88 (moderate increase; CO2 high-ish and slightly warm).
  • Z4: 0.68 → 0.68 (hold constant; comfort is acceptable and CO2 low, so no need for extra airflow).
  All are within [0.05, 1.0].

- OA damper:
  • Increasing OA improves building-wide CO2 but at a significant cooling energy cost due to 34°C outdoor air.
  • We already have 0.33, which is reasonable; Z1 and Z2 are just above target, not near violation, so only a modest bump is warranted.
  • A small change toward 0.36 should slightly strengthen dilution without a large energy penalty.
  • Avoid very large increases that would sharply increase coil load.

- Coil valve:
  • Indoor temps are a bit above setpoint (especially Z2–Z4) and trending warmer, and we plan to increase both OA fraction and airflow. That will increase the cooling load.
  • To maintain comfort while avoiding overshoot and unnecessary chiller energy, we can modestly increase the coil valve from 0.45 to about 0.50.
  • This supports more cooling but not aggressively so, respecting energy cost.

- Fan speed:
  • Increasing fan speed improves both temp control and CO2 for all zones by increasing total supply airflow and effective ventilation.
  • Energy penalty grows with fan power (nonlinear in reality), but we are currently at 0.65, not near the minimum of 0.45.
  • A moderate increase to 0.70 balances CO2/comfort improvements with energy. With slightly higher zone dampers on the high-CO2 zones, this should especially help Z1–Z3.

4) Sanity check over next 5 minutes:
- With slightly higher OA and fan speed, CO2 trends in Z1–Z3 should flatten or start decreasing, preventing approach to 1100 ppm and reducing CO2 penalty over time.
- Slightly higher coil valve plus increased flow should keep zone temperatures within the 25–27°C band, and may slowly pull them closer to 26°C rather than warming further.
- Energy use will rise somewhat (fan and coil), but the changes are incremental, not drastic, which aligns with the weighted power penalty.

5) Final actions and bounds:
- Clip each action to the given bounds (already chosen within bounds):
  • Zone dampers in [0.05, 1.0].
  • OA damper in [0.05, 0.6].
  • Coil valve in [0.06, 1.0].
  • Fan speed in [0.45, 1.4].
- The selected setpoints are therefore feasible and targeted to improve reward by gently improving CO2 and comfort while managing energy.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.92, 0.88, 0.68], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- All zone temperatures are within the 25–27°C comfort band and fairly close to the 26°C comfort center:
  - Zone 1: 26.1°C (error +0.1)
  - Zone 2: 26.6°C (error +0.6)
  - Zone 3: 26.5°C (error +0.5)
  - Zone 4: 26.5°C (error +0.5)
- Temperature trends are essentially flat (0°C/min), so current cooling level is roughly holding conditions steady.

- CO2 status:
  - Zone 1: 1014 ppm, trending -1.0 ppm/min → over 5 min ~ -5 ppm → ~1009 ppm
  - Zone 2: 1006 ppm, trending -0.7 ppm/min → ~1002.5 ppm
  - Zone 3: 986 ppm, trending -0.6 ppm/min → ~983 ppm
  - Zone 4: 842 ppm, trending -0.6 ppm/min → ~839 ppm
  CO2 is slightly above the 1000 ppm target in Zones 1–2, but below the 1100 ppm violation threshold and trending downward already. So only mild CO2 penalty, no violation risk.

- Outdoor air: 34°C and hotter than zones; outdoor temperature is slowly decreasing but still much higher than indoor, so more outdoor air significantly increases cooling load.

- Previous actions:
  - Zone dampers: [0.90, 0.92, 0.88, 0.68]
  - OA damper: 0.36
  - Coil valve: 0.50
  - Fan speed: 0.70
  This is a relatively high airflow and moderate-to-high cooling level, given that temperatures are stable in the comfort band.

2) Objectives vs. current state:
- Comfort: already good. Need to avoid letting warm zones (2–4) drift above 27°C if we reduce cooling or airflow too aggressively.
- CO2: Slightly above 1000 ppm in Zones 1–2 but trending down. We can afford to modestly reduce OA to save energy because we are far from the 1100 ppm violation limit and trends are downward.
- Energy: Current OA (0.36), fan (0.70), and coil (0.50) likely consume more energy than necessary to maintain conditions. We should trim energy while keeping the future 5‑min temperatures well within 25–27°C.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Because outdoor air is much warmer than indoor, supplying excess OA increases cooling load. Given CO2 is already decreasing, we can slightly reduce OA damper to cut load but not so much that CO2 reverses trend.
- We can slightly reduce coil valve and fan speed to reduce energy while keeping enough cooling capacity and airflow to prevent temperatures from rising too quickly above 27°C.
- Zone dampers are quite open, especially in Zones 1–3. Those zones are near or slightly above setpoint; we can modestly reduce their dampers to lower airflow and save fan power, while still keeping enough cooling distribution.
- Keep changes moderate to avoid overshooting: a 5‑min interval is short, but zone temperatures are currently stable; moderate reductions should not cause large drifts.

4) Concrete adjustments (heuristic balance):
- Zone dampers:
  - We’ll reduce Zones 1–3 slightly; Zone 4 a bit less (it has lower CO2, similar temp, but is already the most restricted damper).
  - From [0.90, 0.92, 0.88, 0.68] → [0.82, 0.86, 0.82, 0.64]. All still well above the 0.05 minimum.
- OA damper:
  - Reduce slightly to lower ventilation load but stay clearly above minimum 0.05 and maintain current downward CO2 trend.
  - From 0.36 → 0.32.
- Coil valve:
  - Temperatures are stable and slightly above 26°C; with some airflow reduction and slightly less hot OA, we can trim coil a bit without losing comfort.
  - From 0.50 → 0.46.
- Fan speed:
  - Lowering fan reduces both fan energy and cooling coil load. Because all zones are in band and trends are flat, a modest reduction should be safe.
  - From 0.70 → 0.66.

5) Sanity check vs bounds:
- zone_dampers: all in [0.05, 1.0] → [0.82, 0.86, 0.82, 0.64] valid.
- oa_damper: 0.32 in [0.05, 0.60] → valid.
- coil_valve: 0.46 in [0.06, 1.0] → valid.
- fan_speed: 0.66 in [0.45, 1.4] → valid.

6) Expected impact on reward:
- Comfort: Slight reductions in cooling and airflow are unlikely to push temps outside 25–27°C within 5 minutes; comfort reward should remain high.
- CO2: Slightly lower OA may slow the rate of CO2 decrease, but CO2 should remain below 1100 ppm with no violation, and close to target; CO2 penalty impact should be small.
- Power: Lower fan, lower coil, and slightly lower OA should reduce power consumption, improving the power-weighted part of the reward. Overall, this should increase the total reward for the next interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.82, 0.86, 0.82, 0.64], ""oa_damper"": 0.32, ""coil_valve"": 0.46, ""fan_speed"": 0.66}","{

Need to avoid letting warm zones (2–4) drift above 27°C if we reduce cooling or airflow too aggressively.\n- CO2: Slightly above 1000 ppm in Zones 1–2 but trending down. We can afford to modestly reduce OA to save energy because we are far from the 1100 ppm violation limit and trends are downward.\n- Energy: Current OA (0.36), fan (0.70), and coil (0.50) likely consume more energy than necessary to maintain conditions. We should trim energy while keeping the future 5‑min temperatures well within 25–27°C.\n\n3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:\n- Because outdoor air is much warmer than indoor, supplying excess OA increases cooling load. Given CO2 is already decreasing, we can slightly reduce OA damper to cut load but not so much that CO2 reverses trend.\n- We can slightly reduce coil valve and fan speed to reduce energy while keeping enough cooling capacity and airflow to prevent temperatures from rising too quickly above 27°C.\n- Zone dampers are quite open, especially in Zones 1–3. Those zones are near or slightly above setpoint; we can modestly reduce their dampers to lower airflow and save fan power, while still keeping enough cooling distribution.\n- Keep changes moderate to avoid overshooting: a 5‑min interval is short, but zone temperatures are currently stable; moderate reductions should not cause large drifts.\n\n4) Concrete adjustments (heuristic balance):\n- Zone dampers:\n  - We’ll reduce Zones 1–3 slightly; Zone 4 a bit less (it has lower CO2, similar temp, but is already the most restricted damper).\n  - From [0.90, 0.92, 0.88, 0.68] → [0.82, 0.86, 0.82, 0.64]. All still well above the 0.05 minimum.\n- OA damper:\n  - Reduce slightly to lower ventilation load but stay clearly above minimum 0.05 and maintain current downward CO2 trend.\n  - From 0.36 → 0.32.\n- Coil valve:\n  - Temperatures are stable and slightly above 26°C; with some airflow reduction and slightly less hot OA, we can trim coil a bit without losing comfort.\n  - From 0.50 → 0.46.\n- Fan speed:\n  - Lowering fan reduces both fan energy and cooling coil load. Because all zones are in band and trends are flat, a modest reduction should be safe.\n  - From 0.70 → 0.66.\n\n5) Sanity check vs bounds:\n- zone_dampers: all in [0.05, 1.0] → [0.82, 0.86, 0.82, 0.64] valid.\n- oa_damper: 0.32 in [0.05, 0.60] → valid.\n- coil_valve: 0.46 in [0.06, 1.0] → valid.\n- fan_speed: 0.66 in [0.45, 1.4] → valid.\n\n6) Expected impact on reward:\n- Comfort: Slight reductions in cooling and airflow are unlikely to push temps outside 25–27°C within 5 minutes; comfort reward should remain high.\n- CO2: Slightly lower OA may slow the rate of CO2 decrease, but CO2 should remain below 1100 ppm with no violation, and close to target; CO2 penalty impact should be small.\n- Power: Lower fan, lower coil, and slightly lower OA should reduce power consumption, improving the power-weighted part of the reward. Overall, this should increase the total reward for the next interval."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- All zones are within band and near setpoint:
  • Z1: 26.1°C (error +0.1°C, flat trend)
  • Z2: 26.6°C (error +0.6°C, flat)
  • Z3: 26.5°C (error +0.5°C, flat)
  • Z4: 26.5°C (error +0.5°C, flat)
- CO2 targets: keep below 1000 ppm; violation at 1100 ppm.
  • Z1: 1020 ppm, rising +1.3 ppm/min → ~+6.5 ppm in 5 min → ~1026.5 ppm
  • Z2: 1012 ppm, +1.1 ppm/min → ~1017.5 ppm
  • Z3: 991 ppm, +1.0 ppm/min → ~996 ppm (just under target)
  • Z4: 846 ppm, +0.6 ppm/min → ~849 ppm
- So Z1 and Z2 are already above the 1000 ppm target and increasing; Z3 is about to cross 1000 if trend continues. No zone is near the 1100 ppm violation threshold yet, but we should reverse the upward CO2 trend to reduce ongoing CO2 penalty and avoid approaching 1100.
- Outdoor air: 33.8°C (much hotter than 26°C), but trending down. Bringing in more OA improves CO2 but increases sensible load (more cooling energy via coil + fan).
- Previous actuation: zone dampers quite open, OA damper modest, coil mid, fan moderate:
  • Zone dampers: [0.82, 0.86, 0.82, 0.64]
  • OA damper: 0.32 (on a 0.05–0.6 range)
  • Coil valve: 0.46 (0.06–1.0)
  • Fan speed: 0.66 (0.45–1.4)

2) Trade-off reasoning (reward components):
- Comfort reward/penalty: current temps are good; we mainly need to avoid zones drifting above 27°C or far from 26°C.
- CO2 penalty and violation avoidance: with 3 zones at/near 1000+ ppm and rising, the CO2 term is becoming important. Increasing ventilation (OA fraction and/or total flow) will drop or at least flatten CO2, at the expense of power.
- Power cost: raising fan speed and coil valve increases energy and power_penalty (0.2 * power_kw). However, the CO2_penalty_weight is 0.5 and a hard 10-point penalty occurs at violation. So preventing CO2 build-up is worth some additional power.
- Outdoor air is hot, so increasing OA raises cooling load. Given zones are slightly above 26°C and flat, they likely can tolerate a bit more cooling. We should bias toward more airflow/coil to offset the extra heat from OA while improving CO2.

3) Control strategy for the next 5 minutes:
Goals for this short horizon:
- Reduce or at least stop the CO2 rise in Zones 1–3.
- Keep all temps comfortably within 25–27°C and not drifting upward.
- Avoid excessive energy: moderate, targeted increases rather than aggressive changes.

Key levers:
- OA damper: directly affects ventilation effectiveness (CO2) but also increases cooling load due to hot OA.
- Fan speed: increases total supply air volume (both OA and recirculated) — boosts ventilation and cooling transfer, but increases fan power.
- Coil valve: increases cooling capacity to counter hot OA and maintain temps.
- Zone dampers: redistribute flow between zones. Rebalancing can give more ventilation and cooling to high-CO2/higher-temp zones without drastically increasing total flow.

4) Zone-by-zone considerations:
- Zone 1: 
  • Temp 26.1°C (nearly ideal), CO2 1020 ppm and rising fastest.
  • Needs more ventilation; temperature should not drop below band. A modest increase in supply airflow should both cool slightly and dilute CO2; coil plus OA control should prevent overcooling building-wide.
- Zone 2:
  • Temp 26.6°C (warmer than setpoint but in band), CO2 1012 ppm rising.
  • Needs more ventilation and some extra cooling to nudge toward 26°C.
- Zone 3:
  • Temp 26.5°C, CO2 991 ppm trending upward toward 1,000.
  • Pre-empt CO2 crossing target with slightly increased flow; extra cooling also acceptable.
- Zone 4:
  • Temp 26.5°C, CO2 846 ppm (comfortable margin below target).
  • Does not need extra ventilation; we can slightly reduce its damper to reallocate airflow to Zones 1–3 and reduce overall unnecessary flow/energy.

5) Decide actuation adjustments (relative to previous):
- Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):
  • Currently [0.82, 0.86, 0.82, 0.64].
  • Slightly increase Zones 1–3 to prioritize ventilation there, slightly reduce Zone 4.
  • Chosen: Z1: 0.88 (↑0.06), Z2: 0.90 (↑0.04), Z3: 0.88 (↑0.06), Z4: 0.55 (↓0.09).
    - This mildly increases total flow, weighted toward high-CO2 zones, while cutting some from low-CO2 Z4 to temper energy use.

- OA damper (bounds 0.05–0.6):
  • Currently 0.32, outdoor is quite hot but CO2 is clearly drifting upward.
  • We want a meaningful increase in OA fraction to reverse CO2 trend while not maxing it out (which would sharply increase cooling load and energy).
  • Chosen: 0.40 (↑0.08). This should notably improve CO2 dilution but is still well below max 0.6.

- Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4):
  • Currently 0.66.
  • Raising fan increases both ventilation delivery and sensible cooling transfer. To improve CO2 and slightly lower temperatures in zones >26°C, increase fan moderately without a large power spike.
  • Chosen: 0.74 (↑0.08). This is a modest bump: it should help control CO2 and temps for this 5-min interval, but keeps fan far from its high-power extremes.

- Coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0):
  • Currently 0.46.
  • With higher OA fraction and fan speed, supply air will have higher load from 33.8°C outdoor air, so coil must work somewhat harder to avoid zone temps drifting up. Zones 2–4 are already 0.5–0.6°C above setpoint; more cooling is desirable.
  • Chosen: 0.54 (↑0.08). This adds cooling capacity but still leaves room for future adjustments if temps start to climb further.

6) Check constraints and qualitative outcomes:
- All actions within bounds:
  • Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.90, 0.88, 0.55] ∈ [0.05, 1.0].
  • OA damper: 0.40 ∈ [0.05, 0.6].
  • Coil valve: 0.54 ∈ [0.06, 1.0].
  • Fan speed: 0.74 ∈ [0.45, 1.4].
- Expected impact over next 5 minutes:
  • CO2: higher OA fraction plus more airflow to Zones 1–3 should slow or reverse the CO2 increase; Z1 and Z2 should trend down toward 1000–1010 ppm instead of rising, Z3 likely stays below or around 1000, Z4 remains well below target despite slightly reduced damper.
  • Temperature: increased cooling and flow counteract the warmer OA. Z2–4 may drift slightly downward toward 26°C or stay near current values; Z1 might cool slightly below 26.1°C but should remain well inside 25–27°C.
  • Power: fan and coil energy will increase, but in proportion to a meaningful reduction in CO2 penalty and maintenance of comfort, which should improve overall reward given the higher weight on CO2 and comfort compared to power.

7) Final action selection:
- Use the above values as they directly balance comfort, CO2 control, and energy for the next 5-minute interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.9, 0.88, 0.55], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.54, ""fan_speed"": 0.74}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; violation only above 1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy via fan, coil, and damper positions.

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.1°C (essentially on setpoint), dT/dt≈-0.01°C/min (slightly cooling), CO2=1002 ppm (just above target), dCO2/dt≈-3.3 ppm/min (improving). Over next 5 min: CO2 ≈1002 - 3.3*5 ≈ 985 ppm (back below target).
- Zone 2: T=26.6°C, flat temperature (0 trend), CO2=997 ppm, falling ~2.8 ppm/min → ≈983 ppm in 5 min.
- Zone 3: T=26.5°C, slightly cooling, CO2=978 ppm, falling → ≈965 ppm.
- Zone 4: T=26.6°C, flat, CO2=840 ppm, falling → well below target.
All temperatures lie within 25–27°C comfort band and near 26°C, and all CO2 are near or below target with negative trends. No risk of crossing the 1100 ppm violation threshold in the next 5 minutes.

2) Outdoor and plant conditions:
- Outdoor T≈33.5°C, clearly hotter than indoor setpoints; economizer cooling from OA is not energy-favorable.
- Previous actions: zone dampers high (0.88,0.9,0.88,0.55), OA damper=0.4, coil valve=0.54, fan speed=0.74.
This suggests plenty of airflow and moderate cooling; zones are stable in comfort band with CO2 trending down.

3) Strategy:
- Comfort: Only mild need to slightly cool Zones 2–4 (26.5–26.6°C, essentially acceptable). No need to cool aggressively, just prevent warming above 27°C.
- CO2: Already falling and near/below 1000 ppm. No need for high OA flow; just enough to keep trends negative. Higher OA would increase load because outdoor air is hot.
- Energy: We can shave fan speed, coil valve, and OA fraction while staying in band and keeping CO2 under control.

4) Control decisions by actuator:

Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4):
- Lower fan speed reduces fan energy roughly with cube of speed, strong energy leverage.
- Temperatures are very close to setpoint and slightly cooling/flat; reducing airflow slightly should not push any zone beyond 27°C in 5 minutes because loads change slowly.
- To be conservative and avoid sudden drifts late afternoon, reduce from 0.74 to about 0.68. This should still maintain enough airflow for comfort and CO2 dilution, while saving energy.

Coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0):
- Mixed air entering coils will be warm (OA > 33°C), so coil load is non-trivial.
- Zones are just slightly above 26°C with weak downward trends; we can modestly reduce coil valve without losing comfort.
- However, reducing fan while also cutting too much cooling could allow some zones to warm. A moderate step down from 0.54 to 0.5 balances energy and comfort.

OA damper (bounds 0.05–0.6):
- With outdoor 33.5°C (warmer than supply target), more OA raises cooling load.
- CO2 is already trending down; minimum OA fraction is sufficient to keep CO2 under 1000 ppm over this next short interval, given current negative CO2 trends and no sign of rising occupancy.
- Reduce OA damper to near minimum for energy savings, but not below bound: choose 0.1 (above the 0.05 minimum), providing some margin for ventilation but avoiding high OA cooling load.

Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):
- Goal: Slightly reduce airflow to zones that are cool enough and with acceptable CO2, while not starving any zone.
- Because fan speed is being reduced, we should not cut zone dampers too aggressively; we want to preserve reasonable distribution.
- Zone 1: Slightly cooler (26.1°C) and just over CO2 target but improving. Can reduce damper a bit to save energy but keep decent flow to keep CO2 trending down. From 0.88 → 0.8.
- Zone 2: Warmish at 26.6°C, flat trend. Needs airflow to prevent climbing toward 27+. Keep relatively high, but can very slightly reduce because we’re not trying to cool aggressively: 0.9 → 0.85.
- Zone 3: 26.5°C with slight cooling; CO2 fine. Similar to Zone 2 but slightly better, so modest reduction: 0.88 → 0.8.
- Zone 4: 26.6°C, CO2 low (840) and dropping. This zone has damper 0.55, already lower than others. To avoid it warming relative to others while we reduce fan and coil, keep damper roughly similar, maybe a slight reduction for energy but not too much: 0.55 → 0.5.
All damper values remain comfortably within [0.05, 1.0].

5) Check constraints and expected impact:
- All actions within provided bounds; no clipping required.
- Comfort: small reductions in flow and cooling should keep all zones in 25–27°C; short 5-min horizon and modest changes decrease risk.
- CO2: Already decreasing; lowering OA to 0.1 still leaves 5-min window with trends likely remaining negative because occupancy and generation won’t jump drastically; even if trends flatten somewhat, CO2 will remain below 1000–1020 ppm and well below 1100 ppm violation level.
- Energy: Fan reduced (0.74→0.68), coil trimmed (0.54→0.5), OA reduced (0.4→0.1), and zone dampers slightly reduced, all contributing to lower power while respecting comfort and air quality.

Thus, the chosen action trades a modest and safe relaxation from previous cooling/airflow levels for energy savings while keeping temperatures and CO2 within acceptable bands over the next 5 minutes.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.85, 0.8, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.1, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.68}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm.
- Minimise energy via lower fan, coil, and damper openings, provided comfort and CO2 are protected.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 26.1°C (near-perfect), temp trend ~0, CO2 1059 ppm and rising ~10.7 ppm/min. In 5 min: ≈1112 ppm → exceeds 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Zone 2: 26.6°C (slightly warm but within band), CO2 1048 ppm, +9.8 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈1097 ppm, just under 1100 but well above 1000 target.
- Zone 3: 26.4°C, slight cooling trend, CO2 1007 ppm, +5.9 ppm/min → ≈1037 ppm in 5 min (above target but below violation).
- Zone 4: 26.6°C, CO2 866 ppm, +5.4 ppm/min → ≈893 ppm, safe.

Outdoor air: 33.5°C (much hotter than zones). More OA increases CO2 dilution but adds sensible cooling load.

Key risks:
- Zone 1 is projected to cross 1100 ppm → strong penalty unless we improve ventilation.
- Zone 2 is very close to violation margin.
- All temperatures are within comfort band; no strong need to increase cooling capacity beyond maintaining or slight adjustment.

2) Control levers and their effects:
- Zone dampers: Increase zone airflow (ventilation + cooling) to specific zones. Raising dampers in high-CO2 zones helps reduce/slow CO2 buildup, but raises fan power and reheat/cooling load.
- OA damper: Increase overall fresh air fraction. Strongest lever to reduce CO2 across all zones, but with high outdoor temperature it increases cooling load.
- Coil valve: Controls cooling capacity (colder supply air when higher). Higher valve opening increases chiller/pump energy.
- Fan speed: Controls total airflow. Higher speed improves heat and CO2 removal, but energy scales strongly with speed.

3) Strategy for next 5 min:
Objective priority:
1) Avoid CO2 violation (>1100 ppm), especially in Zone 1.
2) Keep all zones comfortably between 25 and 27°C, near 26°C center.
3) Limit energy by using the minimum increases needed in OA/dampers/fan/coil.

Given the short 5-min horizon and the steep penalty at 1100 ppm, we should be conservative on CO2 risk.
- Increase OA damper moderately from 0.10 to around 0.20–0.25 to get more dilution without huge load.
- Keep or slightly increase Zone 1 and 2 dampers to improve zone-level ventilation.
- Zone 3 is borderline on CO2; modestly maintain or slightly increase airflow.
- Zone 4 has plenty of CO2 headroom; we can keep its damper around current 0.5 to limit unnecessary airflow.

Thermal aspect:
- Zones 2 and 4 at 26.6°C (slightly warm) with no cooling trend ⇒ we should not reduce cooling. A small increase in coil and/or airflow is acceptable.
- We must balance coil vs. fan. Slightly more OA and maybe a small coil increase can maintain or slightly improve temperatures while addressing CO2.

Energy trade-off:
- Fan speed is already 0.68 (above minimum 0.45). Raising fan speed significantly to solve CO2 would be costly. Instead, we can:
  - Increase OA damper moderately.
  - Bias zone dampers towards high-CO2 zones.
  - Make only a small fan increase if needed.
- Coil valve at 0.5 is moderate. Outdoor is very hot; with higher OA fraction we may need a small increase (e.g., to 0.55–0.6) to avoid warming.

4) Concrete target adjustments (qualitative to quantitative):
- Zone dampers:
  * Zone 1 (high CO2, near-perfect temp): keep high or slightly increase: from 0.80 → 0.90.
  * Zone 2 (high CO2, slightly warm): from 0.85 → 0.95 to improve both ventilation and cooling.
  * Zone 3 (slightly high CO2, temp ok): a small bump from 0.80 → 0.85 for extra ventilation.
  * Zone 4 (CO2 low, slightly warm): keep moderate 0.50; maybe a very minor increase is optional, but keeping 0.50 saves energy. I’ll hold at 0.50.

- OA damper:
  * From 0.10 → 0.25. This provides a strong but not extreme increase in fresh air, aiding all zones and especially preventing Zone 1 from crossing 1100 ppm.

- Coil valve:
  * Slight increase from 0.50 → 0.58 to compensate for the hotter OA fraction and extra airflow, keeping temps in band without overshooting energy.

- Fan speed:
  * Leave close to current to avoid cubic energy increase. A tiny bump can help move the extra OA and support cooling. From 0.68 → 0.72 as a modest compromise.

5) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers must be between 0.05 and 1.0: chosen values [0.90, 0.95, 0.85, 0.50] are within bounds.
- OA damper between 0.05 and 0.6: 0.25 is within bounds.
- Coil valve between 0.06 and 1.0: 0.58 is within bounds.
- Fan speed between 0.45 and 1.4: 0.72 is within bounds.

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Increased OA and high dampers in Zones 1 and 2 should noticeably reduce the CO2 rise rate; likely keeping Zone 1 at or below the violation threshold and pulling Zones 2–3 closer to or below 1000 ppm over subsequent intervals.
- Slightly higher coil and fan with hotter OA should keep or slightly lower zone temperatures, staying near the 26°C comfort center.
- Energy increases vs. previous step are moderate and focused on avoiding heavy CO2 penalties, which is beneficial for the overall reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.95, 0.85, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.25, ""coil_valve"": 0.58, ""fan_speed"": 0.72}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C with comfort band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, violation at 1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy via lower fan, moderate coil, and limiting damper openings.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.1°C (near ideal), CO2=1076 ppm, rising 3.3 ppm/min. In 5 min ≈ +17 ppm → ~1093 ppm, close to 1100 violation. Needs more ventilation.
- Zone 2: T=26.6°C (slightly warm), CO2=1065 ppm, rising 3.4 ppm/min. In 5 min ≈ +17 ppm → ~1082 ppm, also near violation. Needs more ventilation and some cooling.
- Zone 3: T=26.3°C, slightly above setpoint but well within band, dT ≈ -0.01°C/min (slowly cooling). CO2=1013 ppm increasing slowly → ~1019 ppm, slightly above target but well below violation.
- Zone 4: T=26.6°C, CO2=878 ppm and moderate upward trend; air quality acceptable.

Outdoor: 33.5°C (hot), so increased OA significantly raises cooling load; OA damper changes must balance CO2 reduction vs. added cooling energy.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.9, 0.95, 0.85, 0.5]
- OA damper: 0.25
- Coil valve: 0.58
- Fan speed: 0.72

Given high CO2 in Zones 1 and 2 near violation threshold, CO2 penalties (and especially the violation penalty) are a major concern. Over the next 5 minutes, we should prioritize increasing ventilation for Zones 1 & 2 and slightly more OA, while avoiding unnecessary overcooling and high fan power.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Zone dampers:
  - Zone 1: Already high at 0.9. To pull more fresh air to this high-CO2 zone, increase slightly towards maximum but not fully open to limit excessive flow and fan power. Choose ~0.95.
  - Zone 2: Already at 0.95 with high CO2; push to max to prioritize CO2 dilution. Set to 1.0.
  - Zone 3: CO2 just above target but safe; temperature slightly high but trending down. Can keep damper somewhat high to benefit from increased central ventilation but slightly reduce vs previous (0.85 → 0.8) to bias more flow to Zones 1 and 2 and save some energy.
  - Zone 4: Comfortable CO2 and temp slightly on warm side. Keep at moderate value (0.5) to avoid starving but not prioritizing it over the problematic zones.

- OA damper:
  - Current 0.25 with OA at 33.5°C. To materially reduce CO2 in Z1 & Z2, increase OA fraction moderately. However, jumping to the upper limit (0.6) would spike cooling load. A balanced increase to ~0.35 should boost ventilation significantly while keeping cooling demand manageable. This is a short 5-minute window; 0.35 is a compromise between CO2 reduction and energy.

- Coil valve:
  - Zones 2 and 4 are at 26.6°C, slightly warm; 3 at 26.3°C; 1 at 26.1°C. We are generally within comfort band but on the warm side. Increased OA at 33.5°C will tend to warm mixed air, so we need at least maintain or slightly increase cooling to keep temps stable or slightly down.
  - Current coil=0.58. Slightly increasing to ~0.6 provides extra cooling to counter increased OA heat load without a large energy penalty.

- Fan speed:
  - Current 0.72. Higher fan improves ventilation effectiveness per zone damper, which helps CO2, but also increases power. Given Z1/Z2 are close to violation threshold, prioritize CO2 control modestly. A small increase to ~0.75 boosts airflow without a big power jump.
  - Keep well below 1.0 to avoid excessive energy use.

3) Check bounds and finalize:
- zone_dampers bounds: [0.05, 1.0]
  - Z1=0.95 → within bounds.
  - Z2=1.0 → at upper bound.
  - Z3=0.8 → within bounds.
  - Z4=0.5 → within bounds.
- oa_damper bounds: [0.05, 0.6]
  - OA=0.35 → within bounds.
- coil_valve bounds: [0.06, 1.0]
  - Coil=0.6 → within bounds.
- fan_speed bounds: [0.45, 1.4]
  - Fan=0.75 → within bounds.

These setpoints aim to: (a) prevent CO2 from hitting violation threshold in Zones 1 and 2, (b) keep all zones within comfort band near 26°C despite warmer OA, and (c) avoid unnecessary extremes in OA, fan, or coil that would significantly increase power.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 1.0, 0.8, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; violation at >1100 ppm.
- Energy: minimize fan/chiller/pump power while meeting comfort and CO2.

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.1°C (essentially on setpoint, well within band), CO2=1067 ppm, trend -1.7 ppm/min → projected in 5 min: ~1058 ppm (still above 1000, below 1100). Needs more ventilation to push CO2 down faster.
- Zone 2: T=26.6°C (0.6°C above setpoint but still within 25–27 band), CO2=1059 ppm, trend -1.2 ppm/min → in 5 min: ~1053 ppm. Similar story: CO2 modestly high and decreasing slowly.
- Zone 3: T=26.3°C, CO2=1004 ppm, trend -1.8 ppm/min → in 5 min: ~995 ppm (very close to target, decreasing adequately).
- Zone 4: T=26.6°C, CO2=877 ppm, trend -0.2 ppm/min → healthy CO2, slightly warm.

Outdoor air: 33.6°C and rising; bringing in more OA substantially increases sensible cooling load. So high OA damper is costly on chiller/coils.

Previous actuators:
- Zone dampers: [0.95, 1.0, 0.8, 0.5]
- OA damper: 0.35 (moderate OA)
- Coil valve: 0.60 (moderate cooling)
- Fan speed: 0.75 (moderate airflow)

2) Trade-off analysis:
- CO2: All zones are below the 1100 ppm violation threshold, but Zones 1 and 2 are above the 1000 ppm target and decreasing slowly. Reward includes a CO2 penalty above 1000 ppm and an extra large penalty only above 1100 ppm. So we should improve CO2 somewhat but do not need very aggressive ventilation that would sharply increase cooling load.
- Temperature: All zones are within the 25–27°C band. Zones 2 and 4 are at 26.6°C (slightly warm), Zone 3 at 26.3°C, Zone 1 at 26.1°C. With hot outdoor air, increasing OA damper raises supply temperature load; so better to use zone dampers and coil/fan to tweak cooling rather than much more OA.
- Energy: Fan_speed and coil_valve dominate power; OA damper indirectly raises chiller load. We want modest changes rather than big increases unless needed.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Keep OA damper around current or only slightly adjust, because outside is very hot. Higher OA would help CO2 but hurt cooling/energy. Given that CO2 is only modestly high and trending down, a slight increase in OA is enough.
- Slightly increase fan speed to improve both ventilation and cooling delivery without a huge power jump.
- Slightly increase coil valve to maintain or improve cooling since warmer zones (2 and 4) might otherwise heat up with hot OA.
- Rebalance zone dampers:
  • Prioritize more airflow/ventilation to Zones 1 and 2 (highest CO2 and slightly warm), maintain decent for Zone 3, slightly reduce for Zone 4 (good CO2 but warm; still needs enough flow for comfort). However, reducing Zone 4 too much might increase its temperature, so we should only trim slightly.

4) Concrete adjustments from previous action:
- Zone 1 damper: was 0.95, CO2 high and temp good → nudge to 1.0 to maximize ventilation/cooling there.
- Zone 2 damper: already 1.0, and both CO2 and temp are on the high side → keep at 1.0 (max).
- Zone 3 damper: was 0.8, CO2 ~1004 trending down fast, temp fine → can stay around 0.8; maybe a tiny reduction would save fan energy but would also slow CO2 improvement. Given it’s near target and decreasing, we keep at 0.8.
- Zone 4 damper: was 0.5, CO2 low but temp 26.6°C. Reducing flow further may worsen temperature, so better to maintain or very slightly increase to assist cooling. However, more airflow here might steal capacity from higher-CO2 zones depending on system design. Given its good CO2, we keep 0.5 to prioritize Zones 1 and 2.

- OA damper: was 0.35. Slightly increase to 0.38–0.40 to improve building-wide CO2 without a big energy hit. Choose 0.40 as a small increase still far from the 0.6 upper bound.

- Coil valve: was 0.60. Zones 2 and 4 slightly warm and outdoor 33.6°C → small bump to 0.65 to maintain comfort margin, especially as more OA will be added.

- Fan speed: was 0.75. Slight lift to ~0.80 to improve distribution and ventilation, a mild power increase that helps CO2 in Zones 1 & 2 and slightly helps cooling.

5) Check against bounds and clip if necessary:
- zone_dampers bounds [0.05, 1.0] → [1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.5] all within.
- oa_damper bounds [0.05, 0.6] → 0.40 within.
- coil_valve bounds [0.06, 1.0] → 0.65 within.
- fan_speed bounds [0.45, 1.4] → 0.80 within.

6) Expected outcome for next 5 minutes:
- CO2 in Zones 1 & 2 should decrease more quickly due to slightly higher OA fraction and higher fan speed plus fully open dampers.
- Temperatures should remain within comfort band; slight increase in coil valve and fan speed should prevent Zones 2 & 4 from getting warmer despite hot OA.
- Energy use rises modestly from increased fan and coil but is balanced against reduced CO2 penalty and maintained comfort, likely improving net reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.65, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Slight lift to ~0.80 to improve distribution and ventilation, a mild power increase that helps CO2 in Zones 1 & 2 and slightly helps cooling.\n\n5) Check against bounds and clip if necessary:\n- zone_dampers bounds [0.05, 1.0] → [1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.5] all within.\n- oa_damper bounds [0.05, 0.6] → 0.40 within.\n- coil_valve bounds [0.06, 1.0] → 0.65 within.\n- fan_speed bounds [0.45, 1.4] → 0.80 within.\n\n6) Expected outcome for next 5 minutes:\n- CO2 in Zones 1 & 2 should decrease more quickly due to slightly higher OA fraction and higher fan speed plus fully open dampers.\n- Temperatures should remain within comfort band; slight increase in coil valve and fan speed should prevent Zones 2 & 4 from getting warmer despite hot OA.\n- Energy use rises modestly from increased fan and coil but is balanced against reduced CO2 penalty and maintained comfort, likely improving net reward."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current conditions vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- All zones are within the band:
  • Zone 1: 26.1°C (very close to 26), slight cooling trend (-0.01°C/min).
  • Zone 2: 26.6°C, flat trend (0°C/min).
  • Zone 3: 26.2°C, slight cooling trend.
  • Zone 4: 26.6°C, flat trend.
- CO₂ targets: <1000 ppm, violation threshold 1100 ppm.
  • Zone 1: 1041 ppm, decreasing at -4.6 ppm/min → projected in 5 min ≈ 1041 - 5*4.6 ≈ 1018 ppm (still slightly above 1000 but moving away from violation).
  • Zone 2: 1039 ppm, trend -3.7 → ≈ 1020 ppm.
  • Zone 3: 984 ppm → ≈ 965 ppm.
  • Zone 4: 869 ppm → ≈ 861 ppm.
- We are slightly above the CO₂ target in Zones 1–2 but safely below 1100 ppm and trending downward with current ventilation.
- Outdoor air temperature: 33.6°C, hotter than zones → more OA increases cooling load.

2) Evaluate previous action and its impact:
Previous action:
- Zone dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.5]
- OA damper: 0.4
- Coil valve: 0.65
- Fan speed: 0.8

Effects:
- Fairly high fan speed and high coil valve → good cooling capacity but higher energy.
- OA damper at 0.4 brings substantial hot outdoor air → helps dilute CO₂ but hurts energy and cooling.
- CO₂ in high zones is decreasing reasonably fast already; temperatures are stable to slightly decreasing.

3) Trade-off analysis w.r.t reward:
- Comfort term: all zones inside 25–27°C; only fine control needed to avoid drift above 27°C in Zones 2 and 4.
- CO₂ term:
  • Penalty per ppm above 1000 will apply, but Zones 1–2 are only ~40 ppm above and trending down.
  • Violation penalty at 1100 ppm is unlikely in next 5 minutes given current downward trends.
  • Over-aggressive increase in OA/fan to chase the 1000 ppm target would notably raise energy and chiller load; marginal CO₂ penalty reduction may not offset power penalty.
- Power term:
  • Fan power ~ (fan_speed)^3 typically, so reducing fan modestly yields meaningful savings.
  • Coil valve at 0.65 suggests we’re providing more cooling than strictly required, given temps are stable or cooling slightly.
  • OA damper at 0.4 pulls in hot outdoor air, increasing cooling load; we want to maintain enough OA to keep CO₂ trending down but not more.

Given current downward CO₂ trends and acceptable comfort, the best strategy is a modest energy-saving step: slightly reduce coil and fan while keeping ventilation roughly similar, with small damper adjustments to protect zones close to the upper comfort edge.

4) Actuator-by-actuator reasoning:
- Outdoor air damper (bounds 0.05–0.6):
  • Currently 0.4, CO₂ trending down in all zones.
  • Dropping too far (e.g., to 0.2) risks flattening or reversing CO₂ reduction in Zones 1–2 which are still >1000 ppm.
  • Increasing OA above 0.4 would drive CO₂ down faster but at the cost of more hot air load and energy.
  • Leave OA damper at 0.4 for this interval to continue CO₂ reduction without additional energy burden. Any energy savings are better taken from fan/coil at this point.

- Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4):
  • Currently 0.8, providing good ventilation and cooling distribution.
  • Temperatures are not rising; small decreases in fan speed should still maintain comfort and current CO₂ downward trend, particularly since OA fraction remains the same.
  • A moderate reduction to 0.75 should give non-trivial power savings while preserving airflow sufficiently; a larger cut risks slowing CO₂ reduction in the high zones.

- Cooling coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0):
  • Currently 0.65, with zone temperatures flat/slightly decreasing toward setpoint.
  • Outdoor is quite hot, but we only need gentle cooling to keep zones under 27°C.
  • Reducing coil to ~0.6 will slightly reduce cooling capacity, likely keeping all zones within band since none are trending upward and Zones 2 & 4 start at 26.6°C (well below 27°C, with a 5-minute horizon).

- Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):
  Goal: prioritize airflow to hotter/higher-CO₂ zones while modestly trimming in cooler/cleaner zones for efficiency.
  • Zone 1: 26.1°C, CO₂ 1041 ppm, both very close to target but still slightly high CO₂.
    - Maintain high damper to sustain CO₂ reduction and comfort: keep at 1.0.
  • Zone 2: 26.6°C, CO₂ 1039 ppm, flat temperature.
    - Needs both some cooling and ventilation; keep damper at 1.0 to avoid any increase toward 27°C and to keep CO₂ falling.
  • Zone 3: 26.2°C, CO₂ 984 ppm (already below 1000 and trending down).
    - Can afford a slight reduction in airflow to save energy while remaining comfortable and under CO₂ target.
    - Reduce from 0.8 to 0.7.
  • Zone 4: 26.6°C, CO₂ 869 ppm, temp flat.
    - CO₂ is comfortably low, but temperature is near the upper target; we don’t want to reduce airflow too much or it might drift up.
    - Keep damper at 0.5 to maintain current comfort trajectory without increasing supply (which would cost more energy).

5) Sanity and bounds check:
- zone_dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 0.7, 0.5] → all within [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.4 within [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve: 0.6 within [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4].

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Comfort: Zones remain between 25–27°C, with small bias toward slightly cooler in 2 and 4 due to maintained airflow and modest coil.
- CO₂: Zones 1–2 continue trending downward but may still be slightly above 1000 ppm at the end; however, they remain well below 1100 ppm, avoiding violation penalty, and the steady reduction will continue across intervals.
- Energy: Slightly lower fan speed and coil valve reduce both fan and chiller energy while holding OA fraction constant.

This balances comfort, avoids CO₂ violations, and yields incremental energy savings, which should improve the net reward for this interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.7, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort: All zones within the 25–27°C comfort band.
  • Z1: 26.0°C (at setpoint, stable)
  • Z2: 26.6°C (slightly warm but within band, stable)
  • Z3: 26.2°C (slightly above setpoint, stable)
  • Z4: 26.6°C (slightly warm, stable)
- Temperature trends are ~0°C/min, so present conditions are quasi-steady.
- Outdoor: 33.8°C and rising; outdoor air is significantly hotter than indoor.

- CO2:
  • Z1: 1025 ppm, trending down at -2.9 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ 1010 ppm
  • Z2: 1026 ppm, -2.5 ppm/min → ≈ 1013 ppm
  • Z3: 976 ppm, -1.7 ppm/min → ≈ 967 ppm
  • Z4: 862 ppm, -1.5 ppm/min → ≈ 854 ppm
  The two highest zones are just above the 1000 ppm target but trending down, and well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold.

- Previous actuators:
  • zone_dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 0.7, 0.5]
  • oa_damper: 0.4
  • coil_valve: 0.6
  • fan_speed: 0.75

2) Reward implications:
- Comfort: All zones are safely inside the 25–27°C band; errors are small and stable, so we can modestly reduce cooling/airflow without immediate comfort risk.
- CO2: Slightly above 1000 ppm in Z1 and Z2 but clearly decreasing already.
  • Additional outdoor air would improve CO2 but at the cost of extra cooling load because outdoor temperature is ~7–8°C hotter than indoors.
  • Since trends are favorable and we are below violation threshold by a good margin, we should avoid increasing OA; we can even slightly reduce OA to save energy as long as CO2 keeps trending down and stays well below 1100 ppm.
- Power: Reducing fan speed and coil valve and OA fraction will reduce fan and chiller energy, improving reward, as long as comfort and CO2 stay acceptable.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Maintain or slightly reduce total airflow and cooling while ensuring zones do not warm toward the top of the band.
- Rebalance zone dampers to prioritize zones with slightly higher temperature and CO2 (Z1, Z2) while trimming flow to more comfortable, cleaner zones (Z3, Z4).
- Slightly reduce OA damper from 0.4 toward the lower end, but not too aggressively, because Z1/Z2 are just above target; keep at a moderate-minimum to continue gradual CO2 improvement.
- Slightly reduce coil_valve from 0.6, recognizing current temps are stable and well inside the band; but outdoor temperature is high, so make only a mild reduction to avoid drift upward, especially in Z2/Z4.
- Slightly reduce fan_speed from 0.75 to cut fan power, relying on zone damper prioritization to maintain conditions where needed.

4) Quantitative adjustments:
- Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):
  • Z1: 26.0°C, 1025 ppm (worst CO2, but improving). Keep high to maintain CO2 reduction and comfort. Set ~0.95 (slight reduction from 1.0 to save a little energy).
  • Z2: 26.6°C, 1026 ppm (warmest and high CO2). Keep at 1.0 to prioritize cooling/ventilation.
  • Z3: 26.2°C, 976 ppm. Slightly above setpoint but below CO2 target; can reduce flow modestly. From 0.7 → 0.6.
  • Z4: 26.6°C, 862 ppm (warm but CO2 is low). Warm suggests we should not cut too much; but its low CO2 and previously lower damper (0.5) suggests it's less demanding. Keep 0.5 to avoid overheating while still saving vs. other zones.
  This maintains good service to Z1/Z2, moderate service to Z3/Z4.

- OA damper (bounds 0.05–0.6):
  • Current 0.4 with CO2 trending down in all zones.
  • Lower to ~0.3 to reduce load while still providing enough outdoor air to keep CO2 trending down and well under violation threshold. Given trends, this should not cause CO2 to rise sharply in 5 minutes.

- Coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0):
  • Current 0.6; temps stable and in band, with outdoor very hot.
  • Reduce modestly to 0.55 to save chiller energy but maintain enough capacity to avoid upward temperature drift over the next 5 minutes.

- Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4):
  • Current 0.75. Reduce modestly to 0.7; this cuts fan power while still providing sufficient airflow with the damper allocations.

5) Check constraints and objectives:
- All proposed values are within the specified bounds.
- Comfort: Slight reductions in coil and fan are small; given current temperatures and no warming trend, zones should remain within 25–27°C over the next interval.
- CO2: OA only modestly reduced; with current downward trends and low violation risk, CO2 is likely to remain near or below target and far from 1100 ppm.
- Energy: Lower fan, OA, and coil directly reduce power, improving reward without violating comfort/CO2 constraints.

6) Final decision: Implement the modest energy-saving adjustments while preserving comfort and CO2 margins as detailed below.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 1.0, 0.6, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.55, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current state vs objectives:\n- Thermal comfort: All zones within the 25–27°C comfort band.\n  • Z1: 26.0°C (at setpoint, stable)\n  • Z2: 26.6°C (slightly warm but within band, stable)\n  • Z3: 26.2°C (slightly above setpoint, stable)\n  • Z4: 26.6°C (slightly warm, stable)\n- Temperature trends are ~0°C/min, so present conditions are quasi-steady.\n- Outdoor: 33.8°C and rising; outdoor air is significantly hotter than indoor.\n\n- CO2:\n  • Z1: 1025 ppm, trending down at -2.9 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ 1010 ppm\n  • Z2: 1026 ppm, -2.5 ppm/min → ≈ 1013 ppm\n  • Z3: 976 ppm, -1.7 ppm/min → ≈ 967 ppm\n  • Z4: 862 ppm, -1.5 ppm/min → ≈ 854 ppm\n  The two highest zones are just above the 1000 ppm target but trending down, and well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold.\n\n- Previous actuators:\n  • zone_dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 0.7, 0.5]\n  • oa_damper: 0.4\n  • coil_valve: 0.6\n  • fan_speed: 0.75\n\n2) Reward implications:\n- Comfort: All zones are safely inside the 25–27°C band; errors are small and stable, so we can modestly reduce cooling/airflow without immediate comfort risk.\n- CO2: Slightly above 1000 ppm in Z1 and Z2 but clearly decreasing already.\n  • Additional outdoor air would improve CO2 but at the cost of extra cooling load because outdoor temperature is ~7–8°C hotter than indoors.\n  • Since trends are favorable and we are below violation threshold by a good margin, we should avoid increasing OA; we can even slightly reduce OA to save energy as long as CO2 keeps trending down and stays well below 1100 ppm.\n- Power: Reducing fan speed and coil valve and OA fraction will reduce fan and chiller energy, improving reward, as long as comfort and CO2 stay acceptable.\n\n3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:\n- Maintain or slightly reduce total airflow and cooling while ensuring zones do not warm toward the top of the band.\n- Rebalance zone dampers to prioritize zones with slightly higher temperature and CO2 (Z1, Z2) while trimming flow to more comfortable, cleaner zones (Z3, Z4).\n- Slightly reduce OA damper from 0.4 toward the lower end, but not too aggressively, because Z1/Z2 are just above target; keep at a moderate-minimum to continue gradual CO2 improvement.\n- Slightly reduce coil_valve from 0.6, recognizing current temps are stable and well inside the band; but outdoor temperature is high, so make only a mild reduction to avoid drift upward, especially in Z2/Z4.\n- Slightly reduce fan_speed from 0.75 to cut fan power, relying on zone damper prioritization to maintain conditions where needed.\n\n4) Quantitative adjustments:\n- Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):\n  • Z1: 26.0°C, 1025 ppm (worst CO2, but improving). Keep high to maintain CO2 reduction and comfort. Set ~0.95 (slight reduction from 1.0 to save a little energy).\n  • Z2: 26.6°C, 1026 ppm (warmest and high CO2). Keep at 1.0 to prioritize cooling/ventilation.\n  • Z3: 26.2°C, 976 ppm. Slightly above setpoint but below CO2 target; can reduce flow modestly. From 0.7 → 0.6.\n  • Z4: 26.6°C, 862 ppm (warm but CO2 is low). Warm suggests we should not cut too much; but its low CO2 and previously lower damper (0.5) suggests it's less demanding. Keep 0.5 to avoid overheating while still saving vs. other zones.\n  This maintains good service to Z1/Z2, moderate service to Z3/Z4.\n\n- OA damper (bounds 0.05–0.6):\n  • Current 0.4 with CO2 trending down in all zones.\n  • Lower to ~0.3 to reduce load while still providing enough outdoor air to keep CO2 trending down and well under violation threshold. Given trends, this should not cause CO2 to rise sharply in 5 minutes.\n\n- Coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0):\n  • Current 0.6; temps stable and in band, with outdoor very hot.\n  • Reduce modestly to 0.55 to save chiller energy but maintain enough capacity to avoid upward temperature drift over the next 5 minutes.\n\n- Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4):\n  • Current 0.75. Reduce modestly to 0.7; this cuts fan power while still providing sufficient airflow with the damper allocations.\n\n5) Check constraints and objectives:\n- All proposed values are within the specified bounds.\n- Comfort: Slight reductions in coil and fan are small; given current temperatures and no warming trend, zones should remain within 25–27°C over the next interval.\n- CO2: OA only modestly reduced; with current downward trends and low violation risk, CO2 is likely to remain near or below target and far from 1100 ppm.\n- Energy: Lower fan, OA, and coil directly reduce power, improving reward without violating comfort/CO2 constraints.\n\n6) Final decision: Implement the modest energy-saving adjustments while preserving comfort and CO2 margins as detailed below."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs. objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, hard violation threshold 1100 ppm.
- Minimize power (fan/chiller/pumps) while staying within comfort and CO2 limits.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.0°C (perfect), CO2=1038 ppm (>1000, rising at +2.3 ppm/min). This zone is already in mild CO2 non-compliance and trending up; it’s likely the peak zone.
- Zone 2: T=26.6°C (within band, slightly warm), CO2=1036 ppm (>1000, +1.9 ppm/min).
- Zone 3: T=26.3°C (slightly above setpoint, fine), CO2=986 ppm (just below target, +2.0 ppm/min; will exceed 1000 soon if unchanged).
- Zone 4: T=26.6°C (slightly warm), CO2=866 ppm (+0.9 ppm/min; plenty of margin).

Outdoor: 34°C and rising; outdoor air is much hotter than indoors, so more OA increases cooling load.

Previous actuation:
- Zone dampers: [0.95, 1.0, 0.6, 0.5]
- OA damper: 0.30
- Coil valve: 0.55
- Fan speed: 0.70

Given OA=0.30 with 34°C outside, the mixed air is warm; coil 0.55 and fan 0.70 supply moderate cooling. Temperatures are acceptable but drifting slightly warm in some zones. CO2 in Zones 1–2 is already above the 1000 ppm target; risk of approaching 1100 ppm in the coming interval if ventilation is insufficient.

2) Anticipate next 5 minutes:
- CO2 projections (linear approximation over 5 min):
  - Zone 1: 1038 + 2.3*5 ≈ 1049 ppm (still below 1100 but further above target).
  - Zone 2: 1036 + 1.9*5 ≈ 1045 ppm.
  - Zone 3: 986 + 2.0*5 ≈ 996 ppm (just at target if trends continue).
  - Zone 4: 866 + 0.9*5 ≈ 871 ppm.
- If we leave OA and fan constant, trend suggests no CO2 violation >1100 ppm within 5 minutes, but we incur rising CO2 penalty since Zones 1–2 are already above 1000 and drifting up.
- Thermal: with 34°C OA, if we raise OA too much without enough coil capacity, zones may get warmer; with coil at 0.55 and fan at 0.70, temps are stable or slightly rising in 2–4. We can modestly increase cooling to counteract OA increase.

Trade-off: Increasing OA and fan/use of coil reduces CO2 penalty but increases power and possibly reduces comfort if not enough cooling. The reward penalizes power with weight 0.2 and CO2 deviation with 0.5, plus a large 10-point penalty if >1100 ppm. Thus, avoiding high CO2 and trending CO2 above target is somewhat more important than power, but we still want to be efficient.

3) Control strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Ventilation/CO2: Slightly increase OA damper and fan speed to improve dilution, focusing on Zones 1–3 which have higher CO2. Since this is a VAV with zone dampers, we can bias more primary air to high-CO2 zones.
- Thermal: Because OA is hot, we should:
  - Not increase OA too aggressively.
  - Slightly increase coil valve to ensure supply air is cooler to offset any extra heat from more OA and fan.
  - Maintain zone temperatures within 25–27°C, ideally near 26°C.

4) Zone-by-zone damper reasoning:
- Goal: Give more flow to zones with higher CO2 (1,2,3) and slightly reduce to Zone 4 which is both lower CO2 and slightly warm but still within band.
- Constraints: Zone dampers ∈ [0.05, 1.0]. Prior settings: [0.95, 1.0, 0.6, 0.5].

Zone 1 (highest CO2, perfect temperature):
- Maintain or slightly increase flow to boost ventilation; temperature is exactly on target and not dropping, so more cool air is acceptable and can be offset by coil control.
- It’s already at 0.95; increasing to 1.0 gives max ventilation benefit.

Zone 2 (high CO2, slightly warm):
- Already at 1.0 damper (max). Keep at 1.0 to help reduce CO2 and slightly cool down.

Zone 3 (near CO2 target, slightly warm):
- Damper currently 0.6; CO2 rising and will hit ~996 ppm. Slight increase in flow will help keep CO2 safely under 1000 and cool the zone slightly closer to 26°C.
- Increase to around 0.7 as a moderate change.

Zone 4 (lowest CO2, slightly warm):
- CO2 has lots of margin. We can slightly reduce damper to free central airflow/power and prioritize other zones without affecting comfort much over 5 min.
- From 0.5 → 0.45 or 0.4 is reasonable. However, large reductions could let it warm more, especially with hot OA. A small reduction to 0.45 seems safe.

Resulting zone dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 0.7, 0.45]. All within [0.05,1.0].

5) Outdoor air damper setpoint:
- Currently 0.30. Zones 1–2 are above 1000 ppm; 3 is near it. Increasing OA slightly should reduce CO2 penalty without too much extra cooling load.
- Given OA is 34°C, do not push OA to high values like 0.6; that would overly increase load and risk warming.
- A moderate increase from 0.30 to around 0.35–0.38 is a balanced step. That improves fresh air by ~15–25% while still manageable for the coil.
- Choose 0.36 as a mid-range incremental increase.

6) Coil valve setpoint:
- Currently 0.55. With more OA and slightly more airflow, we need a bit more cooling capacity to maintain temps near 26°C, especially in Zones 2 and 4 (26.6°C) and 3 (26.3°C, trending up).
- Coil valve can go up to 1.0; small proportional tweaks are best to avoid overshoot.
- Increase modestly from 0.55 to about 0.60–0.62 to counteract additional load while avoiding needless chiller energy.
- Select 0.60 as a clean, conservative increment.

7) Fan speed setpoint:
- Currently 0.70, bounds [0.45, 1.4]. More airflow increases both ventilation efficacy and sensible cooling distribution but uses more fan power.
- Since CO2 is the main issue and air distribution to high-CO2 zones is important, a modest increase is appropriate.
- Raise from 0.70 to about 0.75; this is enough to improve dilution without a large energy penalty or comfort disruption.
- Avoid high jumps (e.g., >0.9) because power_weight>0 and we are not near violation threshold.

8) Check against constraints & objectives:
- Zone dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 0.7, 0.45] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.36 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.60 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.75 within [0.45, 1.4].

Expected outcomes:
- CO2: Slightly higher OA and fan plus increased flow to Zones 1–3 will slow or slightly reverse CO2 buildup, keeping all zones likely below 1050 ppm and further away from the 1100 violation threshold, reducing co2_penalty relative to doing nothing.
- Comfort: Slight increase in coil and airflow should modestly cool Zones 2–4 toward 26°C without driving any zone below 25°C in 5 minutes, given small changes.
- Energy: Fan and coil usage increase somewhat, but these are modest; the gain in comfort and CO2 penalty reduction should outweigh the power penalty under the given weights.

Thus this action balances comfort, CO2, and power to improve the reward over the next interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.7, 0.45], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- Comfort: All zones are inside the 25–27°C band. Errors vs 26°C setpoint: Z1=0.0, Z2=+0.6, Z3=+0.3, Z4=+0.7°C. Slightly warm in Z2/Z3/Z4 but within comfort band.
- Temperature trends: Essentially flat (≈0°C/min), so current cooling level is roughly matching load.
- CO2: Z1=1031 ppm, Z2=1030 ppm (both above 1000 target but below 1100 violation), Z3=982 ppm, Z4=864 ppm. All CO2 trends are negative (CO2 decreasing), but only slowly.
- Outdoor: 33.8°C, hotter than desired indoor 26°C. Trend is cooling outdoors but still much warmer than indoors, so more OA is a cooling penalty and adds load.
- Previous actions: zone_dampers=[1.0,1.0,0.7,0.45], oa_damper=0.36, coil_valve=0.6, fan_speed=0.75. So we have moderately high cooling and ventilation.

2) Objectives trade-off:
- Thermal comfort is generally acceptable; we should avoid overshooting to too-cold (<25°C) because comfort penalty grows quickly (sigma=0.25) and cooling energy rises.
- CO2: two zones above 1000 ppm, approaching the violation threshold at 1100 ppm. The co2_penalty_weight=0.5 and high violation penalty=10 push us to prioritize reducing CO2 especially in the most affected zones, but CO2 is already trending down, so incremental increases in OA/fan may not need to be large.
- Energy: power_weight=0.2 means energy is penalized but less than comfort/CO2 issues. However, we should not increase energy more than needed to correct CO2 and slightly warm zones.

3) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Zones:
  • Z2 and Z4 are the warmest (26.6, 26.7°C). Z1 is exactly at setpoint; Z3 is mildly above (26.3°C).
  • To improve comfort while not wasting energy, increase air to the warmer zones (2 and 4), slightly reduce to the best-controlled/cooler zones (1 and 3), but keep enough flow to help CO2 dilution in Z1, which is slightly high CO2.
- Outdoor air:
  • Currently 0.36 on a 0.05–0.6 scale. CO2 in Z1/Z2 is above target and declining slowly; raising OA a bit will accelerate CO2 reduction.
  • However OA air is 33.8°C, so too high OA would force higher coil and fan power. A modest OA increase is appropriate.
- Coil valve and fan:
  • Current cooling (coil=0.6, fan=0.75) is holding temperatures roughly steady; zones are slightly warm, so a small increment in net cooling is desirable, but not large enough to push zones below 26 or to 25 quickly.
  • CO2 reduction also benefits from slightly higher fan speed (more total airflow and more OA mass flow), but fan power grows fast with speed. A small bump is more efficient than a large one.

4) Concrete adjustments (relative to previous_action):
- Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):
  • Z1: CO2 high (1031) but temp perfect (26.0). Keep high but not necessarily at max; slightly reduce to save some energy while still providing ventilation. Move 1.0 → 0.9.
  • Z2: Warm and high CO2 (26.6°C, 1030 ppm). Keep at max to boost both cooling and ventilation. Stay 1.0.
  • Z3: Slightly warm (26.3) but CO2 near target (982). Slightly lower than before to rebalance flow toward other zones, but not too low to avoid CO2 climb. Move 0.7 → 0.65.
  • Z4: Warmest (26.7) with safe CO2 (864). Increase to improve comfort with modest ventilation benefit. Move 0.45 → 0.55.
- OA damper (bounds 0.05–0.6):
  • Increase moderately to improve CO2 in Z1/Z2 without excessive cooling penalty. Move 0.36 → 0.42.
- Coil valve (bounds 0.06–1.0):
  • Zones are slightly warm; we want a small additional cooling capacity to gently pull temps toward 26 without overshoot. Increase slightly 0.6 → 0.65.
- Fan speed (bounds 0.45–1.4):
  • Slight increase to support more airflow and faster CO2 dilution, balanced against power cost. Move 0.75 → 0.8.

5) Check for consistency with goals:
- Comfort: Slightly more cooling and more flow to warm zones will nudge Z2/Z4 toward 26 within band; Z1 should stay near setpoint; Z3 may cool a bit but remains comfortably within 25–27°C.
- CO2: Higher OA and modestly higher fan speed plus adequate flow in Z1/Z2 should reduce their CO2 closer to or below 1000 ppm, reducing both continuous CO2 penalty and risk of crossing 1100.
- Energy: All changes are incremental (no extremes). We are prioritizing indoor air quality and comfort during what is still a hot outdoor period.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state and objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm; strong penalty and extra penalty if >1100 ppm.
- Minimize power via lower fan, coil, and damper openings while respecting comfort and CO2.

2) Assess each zone:
- Zone 1: T=26.0°C (perfect), trend -0.01°C/min → about -0.05°C over next 5 min (to ~25.95). CO2=1009 ppm, trending -3.9 ppm/min → drop ~20 ppm, to ~989 ppm. Slightly above target now but safely trending down.
- Zone 2: T=26.5°C (0.5°C above target, within comfort band), trend -0.01°C/min → ~26.45°C. CO2=1008 ppm, trending -4 ppm/min → to ~988 ppm. Similar to Zone 1.
- Zone 3: T=26.2°C (0.2°C above target), nearly flat trend; CO2=969 ppm, dropping; good.
- Zone 4: T=26.7°C (0.7°C above target but still <27°C), flat trend; CO2=852 ppm, dropping; good.

All zones are within the 25–27°C band; two are slightly warm side. CO2: Zones 1 and 2 are just above 1000 but decreasing quickly even with current OA and damper levels.

3) Outdoor conditions:
- Outdoor T=33.5°C, much hotter than indoor (≈26°C). Using more outdoor air is thermally expensive: raises cooling load and coil + fan energy.
- Outdoor T trend is cooling (-3°C/hour), but still hot for the next 5 minutes; no incentive to increase OA now.

4) Previous actuators (baseline):
- Zone dampers: [0.9, 1.0, 0.65, 0.55]
- OA damper: 0.42
- Coil valve: 0.65
- Fan speed: 0.8

System is currently providing significant airflow and cooling, driving both CO2 and temperature downward slowly.

5) Trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are already in band and either stable or slightly cooling. We can modestly reduce cooling and airflow to save energy, but must avoid causing any zone to rise above 27°C or CO2 to reverse trend sharply.
- CO2 in Zones 1 and 2 is slightly over 1000 but with strong negative trend even at OA damper=0.42 and relatively high zone dampers. CO2 dynamics are slow; a moderate reduction in airflow likely still keeps CO2 under 1000 within the interval, while starting below 1100 ensures no violation risk this interval.

6) Strategy by actuator:

6a) Zone dampers (zone-by-zone adjustments)
Goal: Slightly reduce airflow to lower fan energy while preserving comfort and CO2 trends.
- Zone 1 (26.0°C, CO2 1009, fastest CO2 drop): Keep airflow reasonably high but can reduce from very high 0.9 to something slightly lower, since CO2 trend is strong and temp is at target and slowly cooling. Choose ~0.8.
- Zone 2 (26.5°C, warmest CO2 1008, good downward trend): Needs decent flow to keep cooling and ventilation. Keep high, perhaps slightly below 1.0 to save some fan power without compromising comfort/CO2. Choose ~0.9.
- Zone 3 (26.2°C, CO2 969): Comfortable and good CO2. We can trim airflow more here. From 0.65 → ~0.55.
- Zone 4 (26.7°C, warmest temp but good CO2 852): Needs some cooling; keep similar or slightly higher than before to encourage slight cooling. From 0.55 → ~0.6.

This redistributes air slightly toward the warmer Zone 4 and keeps Zone 2 high for both cooling and CO2 while trimming Zones 1 and 3 a bit for energy.

6b) Outdoor air (OA) damper
- Currently 0.42 with outdoor at 33.5°C. This is a large OA fraction and contributes a big cooling load.
- CO2 is already trending downward in all zones. We can likely reduce OA modestly to cut chiller and coil energy while still maintaining CO2 below threshold.
- A big reduction (e.g., to 0.2) might weaken CO2 decline, especially for Zones 1 and 2 which are just above 1000 ppm; we want to avoid risking a flat or rising CO2 trend.
- Moderate reduction from 0.42 to ~0.35 seems a good compromise: still a substantial OA fraction while reducing heat load and fan effort.

6c) Coil valve
- Current 0.65 provides good cooling; all temps are in band and trending flat to slightly down. Outdoor is quite hot; we don’t want to cut cooling too aggressively or some zones could start warming above 27°C, especially 26.7°C Zone 4.
- Fan speed will be slightly reduced, so less airflow; that already reduces sensible cooling delivered, so we should not reduce coil a lot. A small step down from 0.65 to ~0.6 reduces chiller/pump energy but keeps strong enough cooling.

6d) Fan speed
- Currently 0.8; lower fan speed saves fan power significantly (often cubic with speed). But too large a reduction might slow CO2 removal and cause slight temperature rise.
- Given all zones are within band and CO2 is falling, a modest reduction is safe. Move from 0.8 to ~0.75. This, combined with slightly lower dampers and OA, reduces energy while maintaining adequate ventilation.

7) Safety/constraints and 5-minute outlook:
- Projected temps: with coil 0.6 and slightly lower airflow, cooling rates may slightly weaken. However, current temps are 26.0–26.7°C, all inside band. Over 5 minutes, even a small reduction in cooling is unlikely to push any zone above 27°C, especially as we kept Zone 2 and 4 airflow relatively high.
- Projected CO2: starting around 1008–1009 ppm and trending down with current settings; with a modest OA and fan reduction, the downward trend might weaken but should not reverse drastically within 5 minutes. Levels should remain <1100 ppm and near or below 1000 ppm by the end, avoiding penalties.
- All actuators remain comfortably within bounds.

8) Final chosen setpoints (already within bounds, no clipping needed):
- zone_dampers: [0.8, 0.9, 0.55, 0.6]
- oa_damper: 0.35
- coil_valve: 0.6
- fan_speed: 0.75

These settings target maintaining comfort near 26°C, keeping CO2 below 1000 ppm (or at least trending there without violation risk), and reducing energy versus the previous higher-flow, higher-cooling configuration.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.9, 0.55, 0.6], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Levels should remain <1100 ppm and near or below 1000 ppm by the end, avoiding penalties.\n- All actuators remain comfortably within bounds.\n\n8) Final chosen setpoints (already within bounds, no clipping needed):\n- zone_dampers: [0.8, 0.9, 0.55, 0.6]\n- oa_damper: 0.35\n- coil_valve: 0.6\n- fan_speed: 0.75\n\nThese settings target maintaining comfort near 26°C, keeping CO2 below 1000 ppm (or at least trending there without violation risk), and reducing energy versus the previous higher-flow, higher-cooling configuration."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort: target 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2: keep below 1000 ppm (hard violation at 1100 ppm).
- Minimize energy: lower fan_speed, coil_valve, and damper openings where possible.

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T = 26.0°C (perfect), CO2 = 1012 ppm, rising +0.5 ppm/min → ~1014 ppm in 5 min without change. Slightly above 1000; needs a bit more ventilation.
- Zone 2: T = 26.5°C (slightly warm but in band), CO2 = 1009 ppm, slow rise +0.1 ppm/min → ~1010 ppm; also above target, needs mild extra ventilation.
- Zone 3: T = 26.3°C (slightly warm), CO2 = 972 ppm, rising +0.5 ppm/min → ~975 ppm; below 1000 but trending upward.
- Zone 4: T = 26.6°C (slightly warm), CO2 = 847 ppm, falling -0.7 ppm/min → ~844 ppm; no CO2 concern.

Outdoor: 33.3°C (much hotter than indoors), trending down but still well above indoor temperatures. So use outdoor air only as needed for CO2; too much OA will increase cooling load.

Previous action:
- Zone dampers: [0.8, 0.9, 0.55, 0.6]
- OA damper: 0.35
- Coil valve: 0.6
- Fan speed: 0.75
These are fairly high; zones are only mildly warm and CO2 is slightly above target in Zones 1 and 2, near target in Zone 3, comfortable in Zone 4.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are near target and mostly stable (deltas ≈ 0). We do not need aggressive extra cooling; we can modestly reduce coil_valve and fan_speed to save energy while staying within the comfort band.
- CO2 in Zones 1 and 2 is slightly above the 1000 ppm target but far from the 1100 ppm violation. To nudge CO2 down without a large energy penalty:
  • Slightly increase OA fraction to improve fresh air.
  • Maintain or slightly increase dampers in the higher-CO2 zones (1 and 2), while slightly reducing in lower-CO2 zones (3 and especially 4) to redistribute airflow towards the more demanding zones.
- Because outdoor air is hot, we should not push OA too high; a small increase from 0.35 to about 0.4 is a reasonable compromise to help CO2 while controlling cooling load.

3) Zone-by-zone damper adjustments:
- Zone 1: CO2 = 1012 ppm, at temperature setpoint. Priority: more ventilation without extra heating. Keep damper relatively high or slightly higher.
  • Previous: 0.8 → keep at 0.8 to avoid extra fan/coil load while still giving good airflow.
- Zone 2: highest damper and high CO2 (1009 ppm), temp 26.5°C. Slightly warm and slightly above CO2 target.
  • Keep damper high to ensure ventilation and cooling, but no need to increase further; keep 0.9.
- Zone 3: moderate CO2 but rising, temp 26.3°C.
  • Slightly reduce from 0.55 to 0.5 to save energy, relying on increased OA to maintain CO2.
- Zone 4: lowest CO2 and decreasing, temp 26.6°C. Can accept reduced airflow.
  • Reduce more aggressively from 0.6 to 0.5 to shift capacity/ventilation away from this low-CO2 zone and reduce energy.

Resulting zone_dampers: [0.8, 0.9, 0.5, 0.5] (all within [0.05, 1.0]).

4) OA damper:
- Need modest CO2 improvement, particularly Zones 1 and 2.
- Outdoor is hot, so we avoid large increases that would raise cooling load.
- Small increase from 0.35 → 0.40 provides more fresh air without a big energy penalty.

5) Coil valve (cooling):
- All zones are 26.0–26.6°C, with very small or slightly negative temperature trends; they’re not actively heating up.
- Current coil_valve = 0.6. We can modestly reduce to lower chiller/pump energy while still maintaining comfort as the fan remains moderate.
- Choose coil_valve = 0.55: slight reduction, expected to keep zone temps within 25–27°C over 5 minutes, especially with outdoor temp starting to trend downward over the hour.

6) Fan speed:
- Current fan_speed = 0.75, which drives both airflow and energy use.
- Because we’re slightly increasing OA and keeping high dampers in the higher-CO2 zones, we should avoid a large fan reduction to ensure CO2 control.
- Modest reduction to 0.7 will reduce power somewhat while likely maintaining adequate ventilation.

7) Bounds check:
- zone_dampers: 0.8, 0.9, 0.5, 0.5 ∈ [0.05, 1.0]
- oa_damper: 0.4 ∈ [0.05, 0.6]
- coil_valve: 0.55 ∈ [0.06, 1.0]
- fan_speed: 0.7 ∈ [0.45, 1.4]
All values are within limits.

8) Expected outcome next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures should remain near 26–26.5°C, staying in the comfort band with slightly reduced cooling energy.
- CO2 in Zones 1 and 2 should drift slightly downward or at least stabilize due to higher OA and maintained high dampers, remaining below the violation threshold and closer to the 1000 ppm target.
- Energy use decreases modestly from reduced coil_valve, slightly reduced fan_speed, and small damper reductions in lower-priority zones, improving overall reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.9, 0.5, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.55, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps: Z1=26.0 (perfect), Z2=26.5 (+0.5), Z3=26.3 (+0.3, slightly rising), Z4=26.6 (+0.6). All in band, slightly warm except Z1.
- CO2: Z1=1009 ppm, Z2=1004 ppm, Z3=972 ppm, Z4=842 ppm.
  • Z1 and Z2 are slightly above 1000 target but comfortably below 1100 violation threshold.
  • Trends: Z1 -0.6 ppm/min, Z2 -0.8 ppm/min, Z3 +0.1 ppm/min, Z4 -1.0 ppm/min.
  Over 5 minutes: approx changes → Z1: -3, Z2: -4, Z3: +0.5, Z4: -5 ppm. So all should remain below ~1010 ppm; violation risk is low.
- Outdoor is much hotter (33.1°C, trending down but still well above zones), so more OA raises cooling load.
- Previous action: zone dampers [0.8,0.9,0.5,0.5], OA 0.4, coil 0.55, fan 0.7.
  Comfort is good; CO2 slightly high but improving. This suggests current ventilation and airflow are adequate; scope to slightly reduce energy while maintaining comfort and safe CO2.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- CO2: Z1 and Z2 are marginally above 1000 but trending downward. Given non-aggressive CO2 penalty and strong separate penalty for violation above 1100 (which is not near), we prioritize energy reduction and comfort. We keep OA damper moderate, not lower (to avoid CO2 creeping up), but avoid increasing it (which would waste energy with hot OA).
- Temperature: Slightly warm in Z2/3/4. Coil valve 0.55 and fan 0.7 are providing enough cooling. Outdoor is hot, so raising OA or reducing coil too much risks overheating. However, temperatures are within band and trends are flat to slightly warm. I will keep coil roughly similar or slightly increased only if needed, but I prefer to conserve energy by slightly trimming fan and relying on existing coil capacity and zone damper tuning.
- Zone balancing:
  • Z1 is at 26.0 and has highest CO2; Z2 close behind. Give them relatively higher damper positions to maintain ventilation and cooling.
  • Z3 and Z4 have lower CO2 and acceptable temps; we can hold or slightly reduce their dampers to shift flow bias toward Z1/Z2 without increasing fan power.
- Fan speed: To reduce power, slightly reduce fan from 0.7 to 0.65 while adjusting dampers so high-need zones retain adequate airflow. This should maintain comfort and CO2 within limits over 5 minutes.
- OA damper: Maintain at 0.4; lowering to save energy might slow CO2 decay and risk drifting upward if internal gains change; increasing would unnecessarily increase cooling load.
- Coil valve: Maintain at 0.55. Raising would improve cooling but increase energy; lowering could allow temps to drift upward given hot OA. Since all zones are in band and close to target, holding steady is a good compromise.

3) Concrete setpoints decision:
- Zone dampers:
  • Z1: increase slightly from 0.8 → 0.85 to support CO2 and comfort at the exact setpoint.
  • Z2: keep slightly high but not max, 0.9 → 0.9 (unchanged) to sustain cooling and ventilation.
  • Z3: slightly reduce from 0.5 → 0.45 (still well above min 0.05) since temp and CO2 are fine; this shifts capacity to Z1/Z2 as fan speed is reduced.
  • Z4: similarly from 0.5 → 0.45.
- OA damper: hold at 0.4.
- Coil valve: hold at 0.55.
- Fan speed: 0.7 → 0.65 for modest power savings without large impact over 5 minutes.

4) Bounds check (given bounds: zone dampers [0.05,1.0], oa [0.05,0.6], coil [0.06,1.0], fan [0.45,1.4]):
- Z dampers: [0.85, 0.9, 0.45, 0.45] all within [0.05,1.0].
- OA damper: 0.4 within [0.05,0.6].
- Coil: 0.55 within [0.06,1.0].
- Fan: 0.65 within [0.45,1.4].

This set should maintain temperatures near 26°C, keep all zones safely below 1000–1010 ppm, and slightly reduce energy via fan speed and minor damper rebalancing.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.9, 0.45, 0.45], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.55, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

Since all zones are in band and close to target, holding steady is a good compromise.\n\n3) Concrete setpoints decision:\n- Zone dampers:\n  • Z1: increase slightly from 0.8 → 0.85 to support CO2 and comfort at the exact setpoint.\n  • Z2: keep slightly high but not max, 0.9 → 0.9 (unchanged) to sustain cooling and ventilation.\n  • Z3: slightly reduce from 0.5 → 0.45 (still well above min 0.05) since temp and CO2 are fine; this shifts capacity to Z1/Z2 as fan speed is reduced.\n  • Z4: similarly from 0.5 → 0.45.\n- OA damper: hold at 0.4.\n- Coil valve: hold at 0.55.\n- Fan speed: 0.7 → 0.65 for modest power savings without large impact over 5 minutes.\n\n4) Bounds check (given bounds: zone dampers [0.05,1.0], oa [0.05,0.6], coil [0.06,1.0], fan [0.45,1.4]):\n- Z dampers: [0.85, 0.9, 0.45, 0.45] all within [0.05,1.0].\n- OA damper: 0.4 within [0.05,0.6].\n- Coil: 0.55 within [0.06,1.0].\n- Fan: 0.65 within [0.45,1.4].\n\nThis set should maintain temperatures near 26°C, keep all zones safely below 1000–1010 ppm, and slightly reduce energy via fan speed and minor damper rebalancing."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort band: 25–27°C, target 26°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize power via lower fan, coil, and damper openings while preserving comfort and IAQ.

Current zones:
- Zone 1: 26.0°C (perfect), CO2 1010 ppm, rising 0.3 ppm/min → ~+1.5 ppm in 5 min ≈ 1011.5 ppm (above 1000 but well below 1100). High CO2 and flat temperature.
- Zone 2: 26.5°C (+0.5°C from setpoint but within band), CO2 1006 ppm, rising slowly → ~1007.5 ppm.
- Zone 3: 26.4°C (+0.4°C), temp slowly rising, CO2 977 ppm rising faster (0.9 ppm/min) → ~981.5 ppm.
- Zone 4: 26.7°C (+0.7°C), near upper band but OK, CO2 839 ppm, dropping.

Outdoor: 32.9°C (hotter than indoors), so more OA hurts cooling load but helps CO2. Prior action: relatively high zone damper openings for Z1/Z2, moderate Z3/Z4, medium OA, moderate coil, moderate fan.

Key issues:
- All temperatures are inside 25–27°C band; only mild overheating tendency (Z3, Z4) but not urgent.
- CO2 is slightly above 1000 ppm in Z1 and Z2, with mild upward trend; Z3 is below but rising; Z4 is fine and decreasing.
- Risk: CO2 approaching 1100 ppm if we cut OA too much or reduce airflow too aggressively.

We want to:
- Modestly improve CO2 in Zones 1–3 to keep them closer to/below 1000 ppm, preventing future penalties.
- Avoid increasing cooling energy much while maintaining temps comfortably within band.
- Slightly reduce fan and coil from previous settings if possible, but not enough to worsen CO2.

2) Strategy for each actuator:

Zone dampers (0.05–1.0):
- These direct supply air to each zone. More open: more flow, better temperature and CO2 control at the cost of fan/pumping energy.
- Z1 (CO2 1010, flat temp): Keep relatively high to dilute CO2; we can nudge slightly up from 0.85 or hold. To avoid extra fan power, I’ll hold or very slightly increase since we’re not changing fan much.
- Z2 (CO2 1006, 26.5°C): Similar to Z1 but a bit warmer; keep high flow to improve CO2 and reduce temp gently. Keep at 0.90.
- Z3 (CO2 977 but rising faster, 26.4°C trending up): Cylinder of concern for upcoming CO2; increase damper moderately to slow the CO2 rise and cap temperature. From 0.45 → about 0.60.
- Z4 (low CO2 839, 26.7°C at upper band): CO2 is healthy and improving; temperature slightly high so cooling isn’t an issue. We can reduce its damper to shift relative flow to other zones and save energy slightly. From 0.45 → ~0.35.

This keeps total relative flow roughly similar but redistributes toward higher-CO2 zones, improving IAQ where needed without raising fan speed.

OA damper (0.05–0.6):
- More OA → better CO2, more cooling load due to hot outdoor air.
- Current OA = 0.40. With indoor CO2 just around target but trending up in some zones, cutting OA risks pushing Z1–Z3 CO2 higher. To avoid CO2 penalties and violation risk over the next intervals, it’s better to maintain or slightly increase OA.
- But outdoor air is much hotter, so a large increase would raise coil energy.
- Balanced choice: modest increase from 0.40 to 0.45 to help CO2 a bit without a large energy hit.

Coil valve (0.06–1.0):
- Controls cooling capacity. Currently 0.55. All zones are within band; some slightly above 26°C but tolerable (26.5–26.7°C).
- Slightly decreasing cooling will gently let temps drift up but still likely stay within band over 5 minutes given small positive trends. We don’t want to increase cooling because that costs power and they are already comfortable.
- However, OA fraction is slightly increased, bringing in hotter air; dropping coil too much might warm zones toward 27°C.
- Modest reduction from 0.55 to 0.50 gives small energy savings while still likely maintaining temps within 25–27°C, especially with good airflow distribution.

Fan speed (0.45–1.4):
- At 0.65 currently. Fan power scales steeply with speed, so reductions save significant energy.
- But airflow is needed for both cooling distribution and CO2 dilution.
- With OA damper up slightly and zone damper prioritization toward high-CO2 zones, we can shave fan speed a bit without major CO2 degradation.
- Z1–Z3 CO2 are just around 1000 ppm; lowering fan too much could cause a net increase in zone CO2 over the next 5 minutes.
- Conservative small decrease: 0.65 → 0.60 to reduce energy but maintain adequate airflow.

3) Check against constraints and reward trade-offs:
- All actions are within provided bounds.
- Comfort: Slight coil and fan reductions may nudge temps up, but they should remain within 25–27°C over 5 minutes due to modest changes and evening outdoor cooling trend.
- CO2: OA fraction increased (0.45), flow biased to higher-CO2 zones, fan still moderate; this should keep CO2 at or slightly below/around 1000 ppm and away from the 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Energy: Coil and fan slightly down; OA only modestly up; zone damper redistribution doesn’t force higher fan speed.

4) Final chosen setpoints (clipped to bounds as needed):
- Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.90, 0.60, 0.35]
- OA damper: 0.45
- Coil valve: 0.50
- Fan speed: 0.60","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.9, 0.6, 0.35], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.6}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current conditions:
- Comfort: All zones within 25–27°C band and near 26°C.
  • Z1: 26.0°C (perfect), stable (ΔT ≈ +0.01°C/min).
  • Z2: 26.6°C, slightly warm, trending up very slowly.
  • Z3: 26.4°C, slightly warm, very slow rise.
  • Z4: 26.7°C, warmest, very slow rise.
- CO2:
  • Z1: 1010 ppm (>1000 target, but well below 1100 violation), slowly decreasing.
  • Z2: 1006 ppm, flat.
  • Z3: 974 ppm, decreasing quickly.
  • Z4: 837 ppm, decreasing.
  Peak CO2 is marginally above target in Zones 1–2 but trending safe; violation risk is low.
- Outdoor: 32.7°C (much hotter than indoors), so more OA increases cooling load and fan energy.
- Previous actuators:
  • zone_dampers: [0.88, 0.9, 0.6, 0.35]
  • oa_damper: 0.45 (near upper bound 0.6)
  • coil_valve: 0.5 (moderate cooling)
  • fan_speed: 0.6 (moderate-low)

2) Objectives and tradeoffs:
- Keep temps near 26°C within 25–27°C band.
- Keep CO2 below 1000 ppm target if possible and definitely below 1100 ppm.
- Reduce power (fan, chiller via coil valve, pumps) when doing so does not materially worsen comfort/CO2.
- Next-5-min horizon: temperature dynamics are very slow (+0.01°C/min), so 5 minutes adds only ~0.05°C without action change. CO2 dynamics are modest and mostly improving already.

3) CO2 and ventilation strategy:
- Z1: 1010 ppm, decreasing – already improving with current OA and damper.
- Z2: 1006 ppm, flat – borderline; more ventilation would help but at energy cost.
- Z3 & Z4: well below target and falling – do not need more OA.
- Building OA damper is relatively high at 0.45, bringing in warm air and adding cooling load.
- Given low violation risk and improving trends, it is reasonable to slightly reduce OA to save energy while still enabling a gentle CO2 decline.
- Also, we can keep Zone 1 and 2 dampers relatively open (they currently are) to ensure they benefit from the available OA.

4) Temperature and cooling strategy:
- All zones well within band; Z2 and Z4 slightly warm but drift is extremely small.
- With outdoor air much hotter, more OA likely increases zone temps if coil is not increased.
- Current coil_valve = 0.5 seems to be maintaining temps with slight upward drift. For the next 5 minutes, even if we reduce coil slightly, the temp rise will be extremely small (~0.05°C baseline drift plus reduced cooling effect). Zones will remain within 25–27°C.
- To save chiller energy, modestly reduce coil valve while monitoring that we do not push warm zones too close to 27°C in a short horizon. A small reduction (e.g., from 0.5 to ~0.44) trades a bit of comfort margin for energy.

5) Fan speed strategy:
- Fan_speed=0.6 is slightly above the minimum of 0.45. Lower fan speed will reduce power but also reduce airflow and thus cooling and ventilation.
- Given CO2 in Z1–2 is at or just above 1000 ppm, aggressively reducing fan speed risks slowing CO2 removal.
- For a 5-minute window, a modest reduction (e.g., to ~0.55) should still provide good ventilation and cooling while saving some fan energy. Combined with a slight OA reduction, we should still hold CO2 below violation threshold and gently improve it.

6) Zone damper strategy:
- Z1 (perfect temp, slightly high CO2): keep damper high or very slightly higher to ensure good ventilation and cooling share.
- Z2 (a bit warm, slightly high CO2): also keep high, maybe subtle increase.
- Z3 (slightly warm but CO2 below target and falling): can maintain or slightly reduce damper to proportionally favor Z1–2 when system flow changes.
- Z4 (warmest temp but CO2 low): we must be careful not to starve it too much; however, its CO2 is very low, and temp rise is very slow. Slightly lowering or holding damper at a modest value to save some air is acceptable for 5 minutes.
- Prior dampers: [0.88, 0.9, 0.6, 0.35]. These already prioritize Z1–2. To avoid oscillation and maintain stability, we will make only small tweaks:
  • Z1: from 0.88 → 0.9
  • Z2: from 0.9 → 0.92
  • Z3: keep at 0.6
  • Z4: from 0.35 → 0.33 (small reduction)
- This slightly shifts distribution towards the higher CO2 zones without major global flow changes.

7) OA damper final choice:
- From 0.45, drop moderately but not near minimum to avoid CO2 buildup.
- Choose 0.38–0.4 range; I'll set 0.4 as a conservative, energy-aware value.

8) Coil valve final choice:
- From 0.5 to a slightly lower 0.44 to reduce chiller power while staying within comfort band considering slow temperature dynamics and the short horizon.

9) Fan speed final choice:
- From 0.6 to 0.55 to curb fan energy but maintain enough ventilation for CO2 control and cooling.

10) Bounds check:
- zone_dampers in [0.05, 1.0]: proposed [0.9, 0.92, 0.6, 0.33] all valid (0.92 < 1.0).
- oa_damper in [0.05, 0.6]: proposed 0.4 valid.
- coil_valve in [0.06, 1.0]: proposed 0.44 valid.
- fan_speed in [0.45, 1.4]: proposed 0.55 valid.

11) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current conditions:\n- Comfort: All zones within 25–27°C band and near 26°C.\n  • Z1: 26.0°C (perfect), stable (ΔT ≈ +0.01°C/min).\n  • Z2: 26.6°C, slightly warm, trending up very slowly.\n  • Z3: 26.4°C, slightly warm, very slow rise.\n  • Z4: 26.7°C, warmest, very slow rise.\n- CO2:\n  • Z1: 1010 ppm (>1000 target, but well below 1100 violation), slowly decreasing.\n  • Z2: 1006 ppm, flat.\n  • Z3: 974 ppm, decreasing quickly.\n  • Z4: 837 ppm, decreasing.\n  Peak CO2 is marginally above target in Zones 1–2 but trending safe; violation risk is low.\n- Outdoor: 32.7°C (much hotter than indoors), so more OA increases cooling load and fan energy.\n- Previous actuators:\n  • zone_dampers: [0.88, 0.9, 0.6, 0.35]\n  • oa_damper: 0.45 (near upper bound 0.6)\n  • coil_valve: 0.5 (moderate cooling)\n  • fan_speed: 0.6 (moderate-low)\n\n2) Objectives and tradeoffs:\n- Keep temps near 26°C within 25–27°C band.\n- Keep CO2 below 1000 ppm target if possible and definitely below 1100 ppm.\n- Reduce power (fan, chiller via coil valve, pumps) when doing so does not materially worsen comfort/CO2.\n- Next-5-min horizon: temperature dynamics are very slow (+0.01°C/min), so 5 minutes adds only ~0.05°C without action change. CO2 dynamics are modest and mostly improving already.\n\n3) CO2 and ventilation strategy:\n- Z1: 1010 ppm, decreasing – already improving with current OA and damper.\n- Z2: 1006 ppm, flat – borderline; more ventilation would help but at energy cost.\n- Z3 & Z4: well below target and falling – do not need more OA.\n- Building OA damper is relatively high at 0.45, bringing in warm air and adding cooling load.\n- Given low violation risk and improving trends, it is reasonable to slightly reduce OA to save energy while still enabling a gentle CO2 decline.\n- Also, we can keep Zone 1 and 2 dampers relatively open (they currently are) to ensure they benefit from the available OA.\n\n4) Temperature and cooling strategy:\n- All zones well within band; Z2 and Z4 slightly warm but drift is extremely small.\n- With outdoor air much hotter, more OA likely increases zone temps if coil is not increased.\n- Current coil_valve = 0.5 seems to be maintaining temps with slight upward drift. For the next 5 minutes, even if we reduce coil slightly, the temp rise will be extremely small (~0.05°C baseline drift plus reduced cooling effect). Zones will remain within 25–27°C.\n- To save chiller energy, modestly reduce coil valve while monitoring that we do not push warm zones too close to 27°C in a short horizon. A small reduction (e.g., from 0.5 to ~0.44) trades a bit of comfort margin for energy.\n\n5) Fan speed strategy:\n- Fan_speed=0.6 is slightly above the minimum of 0.45. Lower fan speed will reduce power but also reduce airflow and thus cooling and ventilation.\n- Given CO2 in Z1–2 is at or just above 1000 ppm, aggressively reducing fan speed risks slowing CO2 removal.\n- For a 5-minute window, a modest reduction (e.g., to ~0.55) should still provide good ventilation and cooling while saving some fan energy. Combined with a slight OA reduction, we should still hold CO2 below violation threshold and gently improve it.\n\n6) Zone damper strategy:\n- Z1 (perfect temp, slightly high CO2): keep damper high or very slightly higher to ensure good ventilation and cooling share.\n- Z2 (a bit warm, slightly high CO2): also keep high, maybe subtle increase.\n- Z3 (slightly warm but CO2 below target and falling): can maintain or slightly reduce damper to proportionally favor Z1–2 when system flow changes.\n- Z4 (warmest temp but CO2 low): we must be careful not to starve it too much; however, its CO2 is very low, and temp rise is very slow. Slightly lowering or holding damper at a modest value to save some air is acceptable for 5 minutes.\n- Prior dampers: [0.88, 0.9, 0.6, 0.35]. These already prioritize Z1–2. To avoid oscillation and maintain stability, we will make only small tweaks:\n  • Z1: from 0.88 → 0.9\n  • Z2: from 0.9 → 0.92\n  • Z3: keep at 0.6\n  • Z4: from 0.35 → 0.33 (small reduction)\n- This slightly shifts distribution towards the higher CO2 zones without major global flow changes.\n\n7) OA damper final choice:\n- From 0.45, drop moderately but not near minimum to avoid CO2 buildup.\n- Choose 0.38–0.4 range; I'll set 0.4 as a conservative, energy-aware value.\n\n8) Coil valve final choice:\n- From 0.5 to a slightly lower 0.44 to reduce chiller power while staying within comfort band considering slow temperature dynamics and the short horizon.\n\n9) Fan speed final choice:\n- From 0.6 to 0.55 to curb fan energy but maintain enough ventilation for CO2 control and cooling.\n\n10) Bounds check:\n- zone_dampers in [0.05, 1.0]: proposed [0.9, 0.92, 0.6, 0.33] all valid (0.92 < 1.0).\n- oa_damper in [0.05, 0.6]: proposed 0.4 valid.\n- coil_valve in [0.06, 1.0]: proposed 0.44 valid.\n- fan_speed in [0.45, 1.4]: proposed 0.55 valid.\n\n11) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:\n- Comfort: all zones remain in 25–27°C band; slight warming possible but small.\n- CO2: Z1–2 should trend slightly downward or stay near target with high local dampers and moderate OA/fan; Z3–4 remain comfortably below target.\n- Energy: OA intake, coil, and fan energy all modestly reduced vs previous step, improving reward while honoring comfort/CO2 constraints."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, with acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, hard concern if approaching 1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy: keep fan speed, coil valve, and dampers as low as possible while meeting comfort and IAQ.

Zone summaries:
- Zone 1: T = 26.0°C (perfect), dT/dt ≈ 0, CO2 = 1004 ppm, CO2 decreasing slightly (−1 ppm/min). This zone is just above CO2 target but trending down.
- Zone 2: T = 26.5°C (slightly warm but within band), cooling very slightly (−0.01°C/min), CO2 = 988 ppm and dropping fast (−3.4 ppm/min).
- Zone 3: T = 26.4°C (slightly warm but fine), warming very slightly (+0.01°C/min), CO2 = 973 ppm, near steady.
- Zone 4: T = 26.8°C (near top of band, trending warmer +0.02°C/min), CO2 = 840 ppm, rising slowly (+0.5 ppm/min) but still far below target.

Outdoor air: 32.6°C, hotter than indoors, slowly cooling outside. Bringing in more OA adds sensible cooling load and may warm supply air; but needed for CO2 when high.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.9, 0.92, 0.6, 0.33]
- OA damper: 0.4
- Coil valve: 0.44
- Fan speed: 0.55
These are moderately high for OA and relatively high for Zones 1 & 2.

2) Key trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- CO2: Only Zone 1 is slightly above 1000 ppm, but trending down with current ventilation. It is very close to setpoint temperature. To accelerate CO2 reduction in Zone 1 without much extra energy, we can keep its damper fairly open and rely on existing OA level or slightly adjust ventilation distribution between zones.
- Temperature: Zones 2–4 are mildly warm; Zone 4 is closest to upper limit and still warming. We must maintain enough cooling capacity and airflow to prevent Zone 4 from drifting above 27°C over the next 5 minutes.
- Energy: We want to avoid over-ventilating and overcooling. Outdoor air is hot, so we do not want to increase OA fraction beyond what is necessary for IAQ.

3) CO2 management strategy:
- Zone 1 is at 1004 ppm, decreasing by ~1 ppm/min. Over 5 minutes that’s ~5 ppm decrease to ~999 ppm if conditions hold. That is acceptable and stays well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Zone 2 and 3 are already below 1000 ppm and trending down or stable.
- Zone 4 is low (840 ppm) and rising slowly; not a concern in the next 5 minutes.
Given this, we do NOT need more outdoor air; we can slightly reduce OA to save energy as long as CO2 won’t reverse direction dramatically.

4) Thermal management and airflow strategy:
- Zone 4 is the most critical thermally (26.8°C and warming). We should raise its damper a bit from 0.33 to increase cooling airflow.
- Zone 2 and 3 are slightly warm but not drifting much; Zone 3 is warming slightly so maintain or slightly increase airflow; Zone 2 is cooling slightly so we can maintain or slightly trim air to save energy but keep comfort.
- Zone 1 is exactly on setpoint temperature, with flat trend. To help CO2 while not overcooling, we can keep its damper high but not at maximum, balancing with slightly reduced coil to avoid excessive cold air.

5) Coil valve and fan speed considerations:
- Coil valve at 0.44 and fan 0.55 are providing enough cooling to hold zones around mid-band under relatively hot outdoor conditions.
- Zone 4 still trending warm suggests we shouldn’t reduce net cooling; to nudge zones slightly cooler (especially Zone 4) without large energy increase, we can keep coil roughly similar or very slightly higher while keeping fan near current level. Higher fan increases energy and can also boost heat gain if supply isn’t cold enough; but with adequate coil we can use relatively low fan speed.
- Given energy penalty, we’ll keep fan at 0.55 (same as before) and slightly increase coil from 0.44 to about 0.47 to give a bit more cooling capacity for Zone 4 and generally pull temps slightly toward 26°C.

6) OA damper strategy:
- Current OA damper is 0.4. With all zones at or below ~1000 ppm and mostly declining, we can reduce OA slightly to cut load while still ensuring acceptable IAQ trajectory.
- Lower OA from 0.4 to ~0.35: modest reduction, still well above minimum 0.05, and should maintain or only slightly slow CO2 improvements. Zone 1’s CO2 decline might become flatter, but given it is only 4 ppm above target and far below violation, risk is low over 5 minutes.

7) Zone damper setpoints (relative allocation):
- We want more cooling and ventilation to warmer zones (especially 4), slightly less to cooler or already comfortable zones, while preserving enough for CO2 control in Zone 1.
- Proposed adjustments:
  • Zone 1: from 0.9 → 0.88. Keep high to support CO2, but slightly trim to redistribute some air to Zone 4 and save minor fan power / reheat. The temp is exactly at setpoint.
  • Zone 2: from 0.92 → 0.9. Slight reduction since it is only mildly warm and already cooling a bit; still high airflow.
  • Zone 3: from 0.6 → 0.65. Slight increase to counter its mild warming trend.
  • Zone 4: from 0.33 → 0.45. More substantial increase to address its higher temp and positive temp trend.
These remain well within [0.05, 1.0].

8) Check bounds and interactions:
- zone_dampers: [0.88, 0.9, 0.65, 0.45] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.35 within [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve: 0.47 within [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.55 within [0.45, 1.4].

9) Expected effect on reward over next 5 minutes:
- Comfort: Slight increase in cooling capacity and airflow to the warmest zones should move Zone 4 and possibly Zones 2–3 marginally toward 26°C, improving comfort reward while keeping all within the band.
- CO2: Slight OA reduction may slow CO2 improvement, but given current values and trends, peak CO2 should remain near or below 1000 ppm, well under violation threshold and with minimal penalty change.
- Power: Coil slightly higher increases chiller energy, but OA reduction plus modest and balanced damper changes should keep energy reasonable. Maintaining fan speed avoids extra fan power. Net effect aims to improve comfort with small energy increase offset partly by less OA load, likely improving overall reward.

Therefore these setpoints balance comfort, IAQ, and energy for the coming 5-minute interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.9, 0.65, 0.45], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.47, ""fan_speed"": 0.55}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, violation threshold 1100 ppm.
- Minimize fan/chiller/pump power.

Per-zone status:
- Zone 1: T = 26.0°C (perfect), dT/dt ≈ 0, CO2 = 1008 ppm (just above 1000) and increasing slightly (+0.7 ppm/min).
- Zone 2: T = 26.5°C (well within band, slightly warm), cooling very slightly, CO2 = 981 ppm and decreasing.
- Zone 3: T = 26.4°C (slightly warm but fine), flat trend, CO2 = 976 ppm and slowly increasing.
- Zone 4: T = 26.8°C (still inside band but closest to 27°C), warming slightly, CO2 = 843 ppm and increasing moderately.

Outdoor: 32.6°C, hotter than indoors, so extra outdoor air hurts cooling load. However, we must manage CO2, especially in Zone 1 which is already over the 1000 ppm target.

Plant status (previous action):
- Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.90, 0.65, 0.45]
- OA damper: 0.35 (moderate OA)
- Coil valve: 0.47 (moderate cooling)
- Fan speed: 0.55 (just above minimum 0.45)

2) Key trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C; Zone 4 is marginally the warmest and slightly warming. Some small additional cooling is beneficial, but we don't want overshoot below 25°C.
- CO2: Zone 1 is above the 1000 ppm target and rising, Zone 3 and 4 are comfortably below but increasing, Zone 2 is just below and decreasing. We want a modest increase in fresh air and/or zone airflow particularly serving Zone 1, while avoiding a big increase in chiller and fan energy.
- Energy: Power has a penalty; fan_speed and coil_valve should be as low as possible while still maintaining comfort and CO2.

3) Strategy:
- Increase ventilation effectiveness slightly, with minimal energy cost.
  • Fan power will rise with speed, but a small bump can improve CO2 removal in all zones.
  • OA damper can be nudged up modestly to help with Zone 1 CO2, but not too high because outdoor air is hot.
- Adjust zone dampers to prioritize:
  • Slightly more flow to Zones 1 and 4.
  • Slightly reduce flow to the cooler/less CO2-stressed zones (2 and 3) to limit total airflow and cooling load.
- Cooling coil:
  • Current coil_valve = 0.47 is giving acceptable comfort; outdoor is hotter, Zone 4 is near 27°C and trending up. A small increase in cooling will counter the extra heat from increased OA and slight fan bump, stabilizing or gently reducing temps without risking sub-25°C in 5 minutes.

4) Concrete adjustments and rationale:
- Zone dampers (bounds: 0.05–1.0):
  • Zone 1 (high CO2, perfect temp): increase slightly from 0.88 to 0.92 to promote more ventilation and CO2 dilution without a large jump.
  • Zone 2 (26.5°C, CO2 decreasing): decrease modestly from 0.90 to 0.80 to save airflow/energy; still high enough to maintain comfort and ventilation.
  • Zone 3 (26.4°C, CO2 rising but still < target): decrease slightly from 0.65 to 0.60; acceptable given moderate CO2 and good temp.
  • Zone 4 (26.8°C, warming, CO2 good): increase slightly from 0.45 to 0.50 to provide a bit more cooling capacity.

- OA damper (bounds: 0.05–0.6):
  • Increase modestly from 0.35 to 0.40. This improves fresh-air fraction to help Zone 1’s CO2 while staying well below the max (0.6) to limit added cooling load.

- Coil valve (bounds: 0.06–1.0):
  • Slightly increase from 0.47 to 0.50. This offsets the higher OA and slight fan increase, keeps Zone 4 from exceeding 27°C, and maintains comfort around 26°C.

- Fan speed (bounds: 0.45–1.4):
  • Increase slightly from 0.55 to 0.60. This enhances air distribution and CO2 removal without a major energy penalty.

5) Check against bounds and reward goals:
- All proposed values are within given bounds; no clipping needed.
- Comfort: Slightly more cooling and airflow should nudge warm zones down or stabilize them well within 25–27°C.
- CO2: Extra OA + more flow to Zone 1 should turn around or flatten its CO2 trend, while other zones remain below target.
- Energy: Changes are incremental, avoiding large increases in fan speed or coil valve, thus reasonably balancing energy cost vs. comfort/CO2 penalties.

This combination should improve CO2 and slightly improve comfort while keeping energy use nearly minimal for the desired performance over the next 5 minutes.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.92, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.6}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and current state:
- Comfort: target 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C.
- CO2: keep < 1000 ppm, strong penalty if > 1100 ppm.
- Minimise energy (fan/chiller/pump) without sacrificing comfort/CO2.

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.0°C (on setpoint), dT/dmin=-0.01 (very slightly cooling), CO2=997 ppm, dCO2/dmin=-2.2 (decreasing, just under target).
- Zone 2: T=26.4°C (+0.4 above setpoint but inside comfort band), dT/dmin=-0.01 (slight cooling), CO2=966 ppm, dCO2/dmin=-2.8 (decreasing).
- Zone 3: T=26.4°C, dT/dmin≈0 (flat), CO2=971 ppm, dCO2/dmin=-0.9 (slow decrease).
- Zone 4: T=26.9°C (0.9 above setpoint; near top of comfort band but still within), dT/dmin≈0, CO2=840 ppm, dCO2/dmin=-0.7 (decreasing).

Outdoor: 32.7°C and rising → outdoor air is significantly hotter than indoors, so excessive OA will raise cooling load and possibly zone temps.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.92, 0.8, 0.6, 0.5]
- OA damper: 0.4
- Coil valve: 0.5
- Fan speed: 0.6

All zones are within comfort band and either stable or very slowly cooling; CO2 is below 1000 ppm and trending down. This suggests we can slightly reduce energy while keeping conditions safe, but we must be cautious near the 1000 ppm CO2 target for Zones 1/3 and near 27°C for Zone 4.

2) Tradeoffs:
- Temperatures: given outdoor 32.7°C, we want enough cooling to keep Zone 4 from drifting above 27°C and Zone 3 from warming. Coil too low or fan too low could let temps drift up, hurting comfort reward.
- CO2: Zone 1 (997 ppm) is right at the CO2 target but decreasing at -2.2 ppm/min. Over 5 min, expected drop ≈ 11 ppm to ~986 ppm (comfortably below target). Zone 3 will drop by ~4–5 ppm to ~966 ppm. So we can slightly reduce ventilation/fan without crossing 1000 ppm, but should not cut OA too much.
- Energy: major levers are fan speed, coil valve (chilled water/coil energy), and OA damper (indirectly via increased cooling load). Given all constraints, small downward adjustments from previous settings are safe.

3) Zone damper strategy:
- Use zone dampers to bias airflow toward hotter or higher-CO2 zones if needed, while slightly reducing total flow where possible.
- Zone 4 is warmest (26.9°C) → keep its damper moderately high (not reduce further, maybe maintain 0.5 to preserve its cooling).
- Zone 1 is on setpoint but has highest CO2 (997 ppm). To maintain its ventilation while cutting energy, we can keep Zone 1 damper roughly as is or slightly reduce but still high.
- Zones 2 and 3 are slightly warm but comfortable and CO2 is fine; given coil and fan will remain similar, we can keep dampers similar or very slightly trimmed to reduce total flow.
Given that damper changes change distribution more than total energy (fan speed is primary for fan power), and all zones are okay, I’ll make only very small adjustments:
- Zone 1: from 0.92 → 0.9 (tiny reduction to avoid over-ventilating but still high to protect CO2).
- Zone 2: from 0.8 → 0.78 (small reduction).
- Zone 3: from 0.6 → 0.6 (unchanged to ensure it doesn’t warm, since dT/dmin≈0).
- Zone 4: from 0.5 → 0.5 (unchanged; it’s warmest and close to top of band).

4) Outdoor air damper:
- Currently 0.4 with CO2 decreasing everywhere and all zones < 1000 ppm.
- Reducing OA slightly will cut latent/sensible load from hot outdoor air, improving chiller energy without CO2 risk in a 5-min window.
- Because Zone 1 is near 1000 ppm, change should be small. Reducing OA from 0.4 to about 0.35 should still maintain decreasing CO2 (as internal generation doesn’t change drastically over 5 min, and we still provide considerable OA via moderate fan and zone dampers).
- Respect bounds [0.05, 0.6]; 0.35 is valid.

5) Coil valve (cooling capacity):
- Currently 0.5; zones are slightly above 26°C but within 25–27°C. Outdoor is much hotter and trending up.
- If we reduce coil too much, Zone 4 may drift above 27°C; its dT/dmin is 0 at coil=0.5/fan=0.6, so decreasing coil will likely cause temp to rise.
- To maintain comfort and avoid penalty, keep coil at 0.5. Small upward adjustment isn’t needed since all in band and some zones are cooling slightly.

6) Fan speed:
- Currently 0.6; all temperatures are stable or slightly cooling and CO2 is decreasing.
- Fan power is strongly dependent on speed, so slight reduction to 0.58 can reduce energy. However, too large a reduction risks temp increase in Zones 3–4 and slower CO2 removal.
- A very small reduction from 0.6 → 0.58 balances energy savings with low risk over a 5-min horizon.
- Bounds are [0.45, 1.4]; 0.58 is valid.

7) Check against reward goals:
- Comfort: Coil unchanged and fan barely reduced, with OA slightly lowered, should keep all zones well within 25–27°C for the next 5 minutes; Zone 4 should not exceed 27°C in such a short window with maintained coil.
- CO2: Slight OA reduction and small fan reduction may marginally slow CO2 decay, but starting values are under 1000 ppm and trends are already negative. Over 5 minutes, it’s unlikely any zone exceeds 1000 ppm, and far from 1100 ppm.
- Energy: Small reductions in OA and fan speed directly lower energy and chiller load, improving reward.

8) Final clipped values:
- Zone dampers are within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper 0.35 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve 0.5 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed 0.58 within [0.45, 1.4].

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1. Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm, violation at > 1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy (fan/chiller/pump) while satisfying above.

Zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 25.9°C (almost perfect), temp trend ~0, CO2 997 ppm and flat. Very close to CO2 target and just under limit – small buffer.
- Zone 2: 26.4°C (slightly warm but well within band), temp drifting slightly down, CO2 963 ppm trending down.
- Zone 3: 26.5°C (slightly warm), temp flat, CO2 972 ppm trending slightly up.
- Zone 4: 26.9°C (close to upper band), temp flat, CO2 841 ppm with slight increase.

Outdoor: 32.8°C and rising; outdoor air is significantly hotter than zones, so additional OA raises cooling load.

Previous actuators:
- Zone dampers: [0.90, 0.78, 0.60, 0.50]
- OA damper: 0.35
- Coil valve: 0.50
- Fan speed: 0.58

Given the short 5‑minute horizon and relatively stable state, we want gentle adjustments to shave energy while not allowing:
- Zone 4 to exceed 27°C.
- CO2 in any zone to cross 1000 ppm (especially Zone 1 at 997 ppm and Zone 3 at 972 ppm).

2. CO2 / ventilation strategy:
- Zone 1 at 997 ppm with zero trend is right at the target. Slight drop in system outdoor air or local flow could push it just above 1000, but crossing the 1000 “target” is only penalized proportionally; the hard violation is 1100 ppm. Over 5 minutes and with small changes, it’s unlikely to jump > 100 ppm.
- Zone 3 is at 972 ppm with a small upward trend (+0.2 ppm/min → +1 ppm over 5 minutes). Still comfortably under 1000.
- Zone 2 and 4 are safer in terms of CO2.
- Therefore, we can afford a *small* reduction in OA to save chiller energy, but we should avoid aggressive cuts that could push Zone 1 and 3 up later.

Decision: slightly decrease OA damper (e.g., 0.35 → 0.32) to reduce unnecessary hot-air intake while keeping enough outdoor air for CO2 control, assuming fan speed is not reduced too much.

3. Thermal / cooling strategy:
- All zones are within 25–27°C band. No urgent need for more cooling.
- Zone 4 (26.9°C) is the warmest and at risk of slightly exceeding 27°C, especially given hot outdoor conditions. We must not reduce cooling capacity too much for the next 5 minutes.
- However, a small reduction in coil valve from 0.50 can reduce chiller power consumption without letting temps rise quickly, particularly since:
  - Zones are near 26–26.5°C (small thermal buffer).
  - Interval is only 5 minutes.

Decision: slightly reduce cooling coil valve (0.50 → 0.45) to lower energy while preserving adequate cooling.

4. Airflow / fan strategy:
- Fan energy is significant and weighted in the reward.
- CO2 is close to target in some zones; large fan reduction might reduce effective ventilation and could increase CO2 later, but in 5 minutes the effect should be small.
- Slight reduction in fan speed from 0.58 while keeping OA fraction moderately high should still ensure enough absolute OA volume.

Decision: modest fan reduction (0.58 → 0.55) for energy savings; this maintains good ventilation and cooling distribution for the next interval.

5. Per-zone damper adjustments:
Goal: rebalance slightly to give more air/cooling where most needed (Zone 4) and slightly less where nearly ideal (Zone 1), without large overall flow changes.

- Zone 1: 25.9°C, 997 ppm. Both temp and CO2 are at good levels. We can slightly reduce its damper to shift some capacity to others and save a bit of local airflow, but not too much so CO2 doesn’t climb.
  → Reduce from 0.90 to 0.85.

- Zone 2: 26.4°C, trending cooler, CO2 963 and dropping. Comfortable and not CO2‑constrained. Slight damper reduction okay.
  → Reduce from 0.78 to 0.75.

- Zone 3: 26.5°C, flat temp, CO2 972 with small upward trend. We should not reduce its airflow; maybe even keep or slightly increase to ensure temp and CO2 stay in check.
  → Slight increase from 0.60 to 0.62.

- Zone 4: 26.9°C, warmest zone; CO2 safe. Needs a bit more cooling airflow, especially as we slightly drop coil and fan.
  → Increase from 0.50 to 0.55.

These changes keep total flow roughly similar (slight net change) while prioritizing Zones 3 and 4.

6. Check against bounds and clip:
- Zone dampers bounds: [0.05, 1.0]
  - Z1: 0.85 (within)
  - Z2: 0.75 (within)
  - Z3: 0.62 (within)
  - Z4: 0.55 (within)
- OA damper bounds: [0.05, 0.6]
  - OA: 0.32 (within)
- Coil valve bounds: [0.06, 1.0]
  - Coil: 0.45 (within)
- Fan speed bounds: [0.45, 1.4]
  - Fan: 0.55 (within)

7. Expected reward impact over next 5 minutes:
- Comfort: remain within band; slight risk for Zone 4 mitigated by increased local damper and only mild coil/fan reduction.
- CO2: likely to stay < 1000 ppm and well under 1100 ppm given small OA/fan adjustments.
- Power: lower OA fraction, coil valve, and fan speed all reduce energy, improving reward.

Thus, this gently energy‑saving adjustment should maximize reward for the upcoming interval while respecting comfort and CO2 constraints.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.75, 0.62, 0.55], ""oa_damper"": 0.32, ""coil_valve"": 0.45, ""fan_speed"": 0.55}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- Comfort band: 25–27°C, center 26°C
- Zone temps:
  • Z1: 25.9°C (near-perfect), dT/dt ≈ 0
  • Z2: 26.4°C (slightly warm), dT/dt ≈ 0
  • Z3: 26.5°C (slightly warm), dT/dt ≈ 0
  • Z4: 26.9°C (near upper band), dT/dt ≈ 0
- CO₂:
  • Z1: 1005 ppm and rising 1.5 ppm/min → +7.5 ppm in 5 min ≈ 1012.5 ppm
  • Z2: 967 ppm, +0.9 ppm/min → +4.5 ≈ 971.5 ppm
  • Z3: 977 ppm, +0.9 ppm/min → ≈ 981.5 ppm
  • Z4: 844 ppm, +0.6 ppm/min → ≈ 847 ppm
- Main concern: Z1 already slightly above 1000 ppm and trending up; others close to 1000 but below. No zone near 1100 ppm violation threshold in the next 5 minutes but Z1 will deviate further above 1000 if we do nothing.
- Outdoor air: 32.5°C, hotter than indoor; bringing in more OA increases sensible load and chiller/pump/fan power, but reduces CO₂.

2) Objectives and trade-offs for this 5-min step:
- Maintain temps within 25–27°C: already satisfied but Z2–Z4 are on the warm side. Some additional cooling is beneficial, but avoid overcooling Z1.
- Keep CO₂ below 1000 ppm target: Z1 is slightly over and increasing; other zones are approaching 1000. Some ventilation increase is warranted, but we must consider energy cost and high OA temperature.
- Minimize power: favor modest changes rather than large increases in fan_speed and coil_valve.

3) Levers and their effects:
- Zone dampers: adjust distribution of supply air (cooling + ventilation) between zones without changing total flow; can prioritize zones with higher temp and/or CO₂.
- OA damper: changes fraction of outside air → large impact on CO₂ and on cooling load (since outside is 32.5°C vs ~26°C inside). Small OA increases may be enough here.
- Coil valve: more valve → colder supply air (more chiller/pump power). Slight increase can cool warmer zones while keeping Z1 near 26°C if airflow distribution is biased away from Z1.
- Fan speed: more speed → more total flow (cooling & ventilation) but higher fan power. Given temps only slightly high and CO₂ only slightly over target in Z1, a big increase is not necessary; maybe keep constant or a very small bump. But raising OA fraction while keeping fan the same already improves CO₂.

4) Strategy for each actuator:

4.1) Zone dampers (previous: [0.85, 0.75, 0.62, 0.55])
- Z4 is warmest (26.9°C) and has low CO₂ (844 ppm). It can use more cooling airflow. 
- Z3 (26.5°C, 977 ppm) and Z2 (26.4°C, 967 ppm) are somewhat warm and near target CO₂.
- Z1 is already at setpoint temperature and slightly high CO₂. Extra airflow to Z1 would cool it below 26°C (slightly away from comfort center) but would also help dilute CO₂. However, we plan to increase OA fraction to improve CO₂ globally, so we can afford to not further increase Z1 airflow and avoid unnecessary overcooling.
- Rebalance slightly away from Z1 toward warmer zones:
  • Slightly reduce Z1 damper from 0.85 → 0.80
  • Slightly increase Z2 damper from 0.75 → 0.78
  • Slightly increase Z3 damper from 0.62 → 0.66
  • Increase Z4 damper from 0.55 → 0.60
- All remain within [0.05, 1.0]. Changes are modest, maintaining similar total flow but better favoring warmer zones.

4.2) OA damper (prev 0.32, bounds [0.05, 0.6])
- Z1 CO₂ is above target and rising; Z2 & Z3 are close to 1000 ppm and also rising.
- A moderate OA increase reduces CO₂ at the cost of extra cooling load.
- Because outdoor air is significantly hotter (32.5°C), we want a moderate, not extreme, increase.
- Increase OA damper from 0.32 → 0.38 (a ~19% relative increase in OA fraction). This should improve CO₂ trajectories without overly penalizing energy.

4.3) Coil valve (prev 0.45, bounds [0.06, 1.0])
- Zones are slightly warm (26.4–26.9°C) except Z1. Latent load not specified; assume coil valve mostly controls sensible supply temp.
- We'll increase OA fraction, which warms mixed air; to maintain or slightly improve cooling, we can nudge the coil valve up a bit.
- Increase coil valve from 0.45 → 0.50 (small increment), sufficient to slightly cool supply air to counteract extra OA and gently pull Z2–Z4 toward 26°C without overcooling.

4.4) Fan speed (prev 0.55, bounds [0.45, 1.4])
- Fan power scales strongly with speed; currently 0.55 (just above minimum 0.45).
- Temperatures are only modestly above center and CO₂ is only slightly over target in one zone; OA fraction increase already boosts fresh air per unit flow.
- Keeping fan speed unchanged avoids extra fan power while still benefiting from the higher OA fraction.
- Hold fan_speed at 0.55.

5) Check against objectives:
- Comfort: slight additional cooling favoring warmer zones should bring Z2–Z4 closer to 26°C while Z1 sees slightly less airflow to avoid overcooling. All should remain within 25–27°C.
- CO₂: OA damper increase from 0.32 to 0.38 should counteract or reverse the upward CO₂ trend, especially in Z1, and keep all zones well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Power: Fan power unchanged, coil up slightly, OA up moderately. This is a balanced trade-off to reduce CO₂ penalties and slightly improve comfort without large energy increases.

It can use more cooling airflow. \n- Z3 (26.5°C, 977 ppm) and Z2 (26.4°C, 967 ppm) are somewhat warm and near target CO₂.\n- Z1 is already at setpoint temperature and slightly high CO₂. Extra airflow to Z1 would cool it below 26°C (slightly away from comfort center) but would also help dilute CO₂. However, we plan to increase OA fraction to improve CO₂ globally, so we can afford to not further increase Z1 airflow and avoid unnecessary overcooling.\n- Rebalance slightly away from Z1 toward warmer zones:\n  • Slightly reduce Z1 damper from 0.85 → 0.80\n  • Slightly increase Z2 damper from 0.75 → 0.78\n  • Slightly increase Z3 damper from 0.62 → 0.66\n  • Increase Z4 damper from 0.55 → 0.60\n- All remain within [0.05, 1.0]. Changes are modest, maintaining similar total flow but better favoring warmer zones.\n\n4.2) OA damper (prev 0.32, bounds [0.05, 0.6])\n- Z1 CO₂ is above target and rising; Z2 & Z3 are close to 1000 ppm and also rising.\n- A moderate OA increase reduces CO₂ at the cost of extra cooling load.\n- Because outdoor air is significantly hotter (32.5°C), we want a moderate, not extreme, increase.\n- Increase OA damper from 0.32 → 0.38 (a ~19% relative increase in OA fraction). This should improve CO₂ trajectories without overly penalizing energy.\n\n4.3) Coil valve (prev 0.45, bounds [0.06, 1.0])\n- Zones are slightly warm (26.4–26.9°C) except Z1. Latent load not specified; assume coil valve mostly controls sensible supply temp.\n- We'll increase OA fraction, which warms mixed air; to maintain or slightly improve cooling, we can nudge the coil valve up a bit.\n- Increase coil valve from 0.45 → 0.50 (small increment), sufficient to slightly cool supply air to counteract extra OA and gently pull Z2–Z4 toward 26°C without overcooling.\n\n4.4) Fan speed (prev 0.55, bounds [0.45, 1.4])\n- Fan power scales strongly with speed; currently 0.55 (just above minimum 0.45).\n- Temperatures are only modestly above center and CO₂ is only slightly over target in one zone; OA fraction increase already boosts fresh air per unit flow.\n- Keeping fan speed unchanged avoids extra fan power while still benefiting from the higher OA fraction.\n- Hold fan_speed at 0.55.\n\n5) Check against objectives:\n- Comfort: slight additional cooling favoring warmer zones should bring Z2–Z4 closer to 26°C while Z1 sees slightly less airflow to avoid overcooling. All should remain within 25–27°C.\n- CO₂: OA damper increase from 0.32 to 0.38 should counteract or reverse the upward CO₂ trend, especially in Z1, and keep all zones well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold.\n- Power: Fan power unchanged, coil up slightly, OA up moderately. This is a balanced trade-off to reduce CO₂ penalties and slightly improve comfort without large energy increases.\n\n6) Final actions (already clipped to bounds):\n- zone_dampers: [0.80, 0.78, 0.66, 0.60]\n- oa_damper: 0.38\n- coil_valve: 0.50\n- fan_speed: 0.55"",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- Comfort: All zones within comfort band (25-27°C). Zone temps: Z1=26.0, Z2=26.4, Z3=26.5, Z4=26.9. All temp deltas ≈0, so system is roughly in steady state near target with slight warm bias in Z2-Z4.
- CO2: Z1=1005 (slightly above 1000 and still rising +0.1 ppm/min), Z2=963 (falling), Z3=975 (falling), Z4=842 (falling). No zone near the 1100 ppm violation threshold, but Z1 is just above target and trending up.
- Outdoor: 32.3°C and trending down, but still much hotter than indoors, so additional outdoor air significantly increases cooling load.
- Previous actions: zone_dampers=[0.8,0.78,0.66,0.6], oa_damper=0.38, coil_valve=0.5, fan_speed=0.55. Energy use is moderate.

2) Objectives over next 5 minutes:
- Maintain temps within 25-27°C and as close to 26°C as practical.
- Reduce Z1 CO2 slightly below 1000 ppm and maintain all zones safely below 1000 while avoiding approaching 1100.
- Minimize fan/chiller energy subject to the above.

3) Trade-offs and control levers:
- Zone dampers: Increase a zone damper → more supply air to that zone → helps cooling and CO2 dilution but increases total flow and fan power somewhat.
- OA damper: More OA → better CO2 control but strong increase in chiller load due to 32.3°C outdoor air.
- Coil valve: Higher → colder supply air, more cooling but more chiller energy.
- Fan speed: Higher → more airflow to all zones (cooling + CO2 dilution) but higher fan energy.

Given: power_weight=0.2 and co2_penalty_weight=0.5, so CO2 deviations are relatively more penalized than power. We must particularly address Zone 1 CO2 > target while being cautious with additional energy.

4) CO2 strategy:
- Z1 is just over target and slightly rising; others are below target and declining. We can:
  a) Slightly boost OA damper to provide more fresh air building-wide.
  b) Slightly boost overall airflow (fan speed) and Z1 damper to preferentially supply more air to Z1 without big global energy increase.
- Avoid large OA jumps because outdoor air is hot and will drive up cooling load.

5) Temperature strategy:
- Z4 at 26.9°C is close to upper comfort bound; Z2 and Z3 slightly warm; Z1 at target.
- Ratios: Z4 may need a bit more air; Z2/Z3 moderate; Z1 must not be starved (CO2 concern).
- Coil valve at 0.5 and fan 0.55 are currently maintaining steady temps. Because outdoor is well above indoor, load will persist; a small increase in cooling capacity is reasonable to maintain or slightly reduce temps without a large jump in power.

6) Proposed qualitative adjustments:
- Zone dampers:
  * Z1: slightly up (to increase ventilation and maintain temp near 26) → from 0.80 to about 0.82.
  * Z2: roughly maintain or tiny decrease (its CO2 is improving, temp only slightly high) → from 0.78 to about 0.76.
  * Z3: similar mild support but not aggressive → from 0.66 to about 0.67.
  * Z4: slightly up to help it not exceed 27°C → from 0.60 to about 0.64.
  This keeps airflow distribution favoring Z1 & Z4.

- OA damper:
  * Small increase to nudge CO2 down, but not large because of 32.3°C outdoor air → from 0.38 to about 0.40.

- Coil valve:
  * Slight increase to handle the additional OA heat and pull slightly warm zones down toward 26°C, but not large to avoid big chiller energy increase → from 0.50 to about 0.52.

- Fan speed:
  * Slight increase to assist both CO2 dilution and cooling, again modest due to power penalty → from 0.55 to about 0.57.

7) Check against bounds:
- zone_dampers bounds: [0.05,1.0] → all proposed values (0.82, 0.76, 0.67, 0.64) are within bounds.
- oa_damper bounds: [0.05,0.6] → 0.40 is within bounds.
- coil_valve bounds: [0.06,1.0] → 0.52 is within bounds.
- fan_speed bounds: [0.45,1.4] → 0.57 is within bounds.

8) Expected outcomes:
- Temps: Slightly increased cooling and airflow should hold Z1 near 26, bring Z2/Z3 marginally closer to 26, and prevent Z4 from exceeding 27. All should remain comfortably inside band.
- CO2: Extra OA plus more airflow and a bit more air to Z1 should reverse the small upward trend and likely bring Z1 below 1000 ppm within or soon after the next interval, while maintaining other zones well below target.
- Energy: Only small increments in coil valve, fan speed, and OA damper, balancing comfort and CO2 penalties against modest additional power.

This combination should improve CO2 margin and slightly reinforce comfort while incurring only a small energy increase, aligning with the reward structure.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.82, 0.76, 0.67, 0.64], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.52, ""fan_speed"": 0.57}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state:
- Time: 16:35, still warm outside (32.1°C) but trending down.
- Comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps:
  • Zone 1: 25.9°C (essentially on setpoint), CO2 1000 ppm (at target), temp/CO2 trends slightly downward.
  • Zone 2: 26.3°C (0.3°C above setpoint but well within band), CO2 958 ppm and falling.
  • Zone 3: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint, mid-band), CO2 969 ppm and falling.
  • Zone 4: 26.9°C (0.9°C above setpoint but just inside 27°C upper band), CO2 836 ppm and falling.
- All CO2 values are below 1000 ppm and trending down, so ventilation is currently sufficient; risk of crossing 1100 ppm in next 5 minutes is near zero.
- Previous actuators:
  • Zone dampers: [0.82, 0.76, 0.67, 0.64]
  • OA damper: 0.40
  • Coil valve: 0.52
  • Fan speed: 0.57

2) Objectives and trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- Maintain temps in 25–27°C band and close to 26°C.
- Keep CO2 < 1000 ppm and away from 1100 ppm violation threshold.
- Reduce power use (fan + chiller) while maintaining above.
- Disturb system gently: no abrupt changes that might overshoot or cause comfort/CO2 issues.

3) Comfort assessment and cooling needs:
- Zone 1 is nearly perfect (25.9°C). No need for more cooling there; even a slight reduction in cooling would be acceptable.
- Zones 2 & 3: modestly warm but inside band. With 5 minutes and outside at 32.1°C, we want to avoid these drifting upward, but we’re already providing non-trivial cooling (coil 0.52, fan 0.57). Maintaining or only slightly reducing cooling is safer than an aggressive reduction.
- Zone 4 is the warmest (26.9°C) but still within the band. We should avoid decreasing cooling to Zone 4; slight increase to its damper could help nudge it toward 26–26.5°C without big extra energy.

4) CO2 assessment and OA strategy:
- Current CO2:
  • Z1: 1000 ppm, trending −1 ppm/min → in 5 min ~995 ppm.
  • Z2: 958 ppm, trending down.
  • Z3: 969 ppm, trending down.
  • Z4: 836 ppm, trending down.
- All are decreasing, so we can slightly reduce outdoor air to save energy (lower ventilation load and possibly fan power), but we must keep Z1 safely below 1000 ppm over the interval. Since Z1 is exactly at 1000 ppm but trending down with current OA damper 0.40, a small reduction to ~0.35 should still keep CO2 below target; the trend is likely driven more by occupancy/metabolic generation vs ventilation. We should not over-reduce OA.

5) Fan speed and coil valve trade-off:
- Power term penalizes higher fan speed and higher coil valve (implying more chilled water and chiller energy).
- Currently:
  • Fan 0.57 (min 0.45)
  • Coil 0.52 (min 0.06)
- All zone temps are stable (temp_delta ≈ 0), meaning current total cooling roughly balances loads. A small downward adjustment in both fan and valve is reasonable; we can attempt slight energy reduction while likely staying within band, especially with outdoor temperature trending down.
- Strategy: modest reductions, not aggressive, to avoid pushing Zone 4 above 27°C.

6) Zone damper distribution:
- Present dampers: [0.82, 0.76, 0.67, 0.64]
- Zone conditions:
  • Z1: very good temp, highest CO2. Reducing its damper might hurt its CO2 more than help; however, OA and fan changes affect all zones, not individual CO2 directly. But smaller Z1 damper reduces cooling there, which is acceptable and also reduces its share of total airflow.
  • Z2 & Z3: mid-band; keep around current or slightly adjust.
  • Z4: warmest; beneficial to slightly increase flow to improve comfort.
- Net airflow (fan) will be slightly reduced; to keep Zone 4 comfortable we can reallocate a bit more of the available flow to Zone 4 and slightly trim Z1 (and minimally adjust Z2/Z3).

7) Concrete adjustments (balanced, small-step policy):
- Zone dampers:
  • Zone 1: reduce slightly from 0.82 → 0.78 to cut some cooling where not needed and modestly save energy; still fairly open.
  • Zone 2: keep nearly same, perhaps slight reduction from 0.76 → 0.75 (still comfortable and CO2 fine).
  • Zone 3: keep same at 0.67; its temp is on the warmer side but acceptable.
  • Zone 4: slightly increase from 0.64 → 0.68 to prioritize cooling to the warmest zone.
  These are small, within [0.05, 1.0], and unlikely to destabilize conditions.

- OA damper:
  • Reduce from 0.40 → 0.35 to save some ventilation/cooling load while keeping CO2 below target (all CO2 trends are downward). 0.35 remains well above the minimum 0.05.

- Coil valve:
  • Reduce slightly from 0.52 → 0.48. This reduces chiller/pump load modestly; given stable temps and slight reallocation to Zone 4, this should keep all zones within band, especially with only a 5-minute horizon and slowly cooling outside.

- Fan speed:
  • Reduce slightly from 0.57 → 0.54 to cut fan energy. This is still above the 0.45 minimum, and with modest coil and damper adjustments, airflow should remain sufficient to maintain comfort and CO2.

8) Check against bounds and objectives:
- Zone dampers [0.78, 0.75, 0.67, 0.68] ∈ [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper 0.35 ∈ [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve 0.48 ∈ [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed 0.54 ∈ [0.45, 1.4].
- Expected outcomes next 5 minutes:
  • Comfort: All zones should remain within 25–27°C; slight extra priority to Zone 4 should prevent it from crossing 27°C despite small global reductions.
  • CO2: With all zones currently below 1000 ppm and decreasing, OA 0.35 and maintained airflow should keep them below target and far from 1100 ppm; violation risk minimal.
  • Energy: Slight reductions in fan speed, coil valve, and OA damper decrease total power, improving the reward while preserving comfort and air quality.

9) Therefore, select a mildly energy-saving, comfort-preserving action set as below.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.78, 0.75, 0.67, 0.68], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.48, ""fan_speed"": 0.54}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1) Interpret current state:\n- Time: 16:35, still warm outside (32.1°C) but trending down.\n- Comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.\n- Zone temps:\n  • Zone 1: 25.9°C (essentially on setpoint), CO2 1000 ppm (at target), temp/CO2 trends slightly downward.\n  • Zone 2: 26.3°C (0.3°C above setpoint but well within band), CO2 958 ppm and falling.\n  • Zone 3: 26.5°C (0.5°C above setpoint, mid-band), CO2 969 ppm and falling.\n  • Zone 4: 26.9°C (0.9°C above setpoint but just inside 27°C upper band), CO2 836 ppm and falling.\n- All CO2 values are below 1000 ppm and trending down, so ventilation is currently sufficient; risk of crossing 1100 ppm in next 5 minutes is near zero.\n- Previous actuators:\n  • Zone dampers: [0.82, 0.76, 0.67, 0.64]\n  • OA damper: 0.40\n  • Coil valve: 0.52\n  • Fan speed: 0.57\n\n2) Objectives and trade-offs for next 5 minutes:\n- Maintain temps in 25–27°C band and close to 26°C.\n- Keep CO2 < 1000 ppm and away from 1100 ppm violation threshold.\n- Reduce power use (fan + chiller) while maintaining above.\n- Disturb system gently: no abrupt changes that might overshoot or cause comfort/CO2 issues.\n\n3) Comfort assessment and cooling needs:\n- Zone 1 is nearly perfect (25.9°C). No need for more cooling there; even a slight reduction in cooling would be acceptable.\n- Zones 2 & 3: modestly warm but inside band. With 5 minutes and outside at 32.1°C, we want to avoid these drifting upward, but we’re already providing non-trivial cooling (coil 0.52, fan 0.57). Maintaining or only slightly reducing cooling is safer than an aggressive reduction.\n- Zone 4 is the warmest (26.9°C) but still within the band. We should avoid decreasing cooling to Zone 4; slight increase to its damper could help nudge it toward 26–26.5°C without big extra energy.\n\n4) CO2 assessment and OA strategy:\n- Current CO2:\n  • Z1: 1000 ppm, trending −1 ppm/min → in 5 min ~995 ppm.\n  • Z2: 958 ppm, trending down.\n  • Z3: 969 ppm, trending down.\n  • Z4: 836 ppm, trending down.\n- All are decreasing, so we can slightly reduce outdoor air to save energy (lower ventilation load and possibly fan power), but we must keep Z1 safely below 1000 ppm over the interval. Since Z1 is exactly at 1000 ppm but trending down with current OA damper 0.40, a small reduction to ~0.35 should still keep CO2 below target; the trend is likely driven more by occupancy/metabolic generation vs ventilation. We should not over-reduce OA.\n\n5) Fan speed and coil valve trade-off:\n- Power term penalizes higher fan speed and higher coil valve (implying more chilled water and chiller energy).\n- Currently:\n  • Fan 0.57 (min 0.45)\n  • Coil 0.52 (min 0.06)\n- All zone temps are stable (temp_delta ≈ 0), meaning current total cooling roughly balances loads. A small downward adjustment in both fan and valve is reasonable; we can attempt slight energy reduction while likely staying within band, especially with outdoor temperature trending down.\n- Strategy: modest reductions, not aggressive, to avoid pushing Zone 4 above 27°C.\n\n6) Zone damper distribution:\n- Present dampers: [0.82, 0.76, 0.67, 0.64]\n- Zone conditions:\n  • Z1: very good temp, highest CO2. Reducing its damper might hurt its CO2 more than help; however, OA and fan changes affect all zones, not individual CO2 directly. But smaller Z1 damper reduces cooling there, which is acceptable and also reduces its share of total airflow.\n  • Z2 & Z3: mid-band; keep around current or slightly adjust.\n  • Z4: warmest; beneficial to slightly increase flow to improve comfort.\n- Net airflow (fan) will be slightly reduced; to keep Zone 4 comfortable we can reallocate a bit more of the available flow to Zone 4 and slightly trim Z1 (and minimally adjust Z2/Z3).\n\n7) Concrete adjustments (balanced, small-step policy):\n- Zone dampers:\n  • Zone 1: reduce slightly from 0.82 → 0.78 to cut some cooling where not needed and modestly save energy; still fairly open.\n  • Zone 2: keep nearly same, perhaps slight reduction from 0.76 → 0.75 (still comfortable and CO2 fine).\n  • Zone 3: keep same at 0.67; its temp is on the warmer side but acceptable.\n  • Zone 4: slightly increase from 0.64 → 0.68 to prioritize cooling to the warmest zone.\n  These are small, within [0.05, 1.0], and unlikely to destabilize conditions.\n\n- OA damper:\n  • Reduce from 0.40 → 0.35 to save some ventilation/cooling load while keeping CO2 below target (all CO2 trends are downward). 0.35 remains well above the minimum 0.05.\n\n- Coil valve:\n  • Reduce slightly from 0.52 → 0.48. This reduces chiller/pump load modestly; given stable temps and slight reallocation to Zone 4, this should keep all zones within band, especially with only a 5-minute horizon and slowly cooling outside.\n\n- Fan speed:\n  • Reduce slightly from 0.57 → 0.54 to cut fan energy. This is still above the 0.45 minimum, and with modest coil and damper adjustments, airflow should remain sufficient to maintain comfort and CO2.\n\n8) Check against bounds and objectives:\n- Zone dampers [0.78, 0.75, 0.67, 0.68] ∈ [0.05, 1.0].\n- OA damper 0.35 ∈ [0.05, 0.6].\n- Coil valve 0.48 ∈ [0.06, 1.0].\n- Fan speed 0.54 ∈ [0.45, 1.4].\n- Expected outcomes next 5 minutes:\n  • Comfort: All zones should remain within 25–27°C; slight extra priority to Zone 4 should prevent it from crossing 27°C despite small global reductions.\n  • CO2: With all zones currently below 1000 ppm and decreasing, OA 0.35 and maintained airflow should keep them below target and far from 1100 ppm; violation risk minimal.\n  • Energy: Slight reductions in fan speed, coil valve, and OA damper decrease total power, improving the reward while preserving comfort and air quality.\n\n9) Therefore, select a mildly energy-saving, comfort-preserving action set as below."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C, center 26°C.
- Current temps: Z1 26.0, Z2 26.3, Z3 26.5, Z4 26.8°C. All within band; Z1 exactly at center, others slightly warm but still acceptable.
- Temp trends are ~0°C/min (Z4 is cooling very slightly). No urgent need for more cooling; we mainly want to avoid overshooting below 25°C, especially given strong comfort penalty outside band.

2) CO2 assessment:
- CO2 now: Z1 1007 ppm (slightly above 1000 target), Z2 961, Z3 971, Z4 836 ppm.
- Trends (ppm/min): Z1 +1.3, Z2 +0.6, Z3 +0.3, Z4 -0.1.
- Over 5 minutes, projected changes: Z1 ~+6.5 → ~1013.5; Z2 ~+3 → ~964; Z3 ~+1.5 → ~972.5; Z4 ~-0.5 → ~835.5.
- All values remain below violation threshold 1100 ppm, but Z1 is above 1000 target and rising fastest. Reward includes co2_penalty_weight, so modest improvement in CO2 is valuable as long as energy doesn’t increase too much.

3) Outdoor air and energy tradeoff:
- Outdoor temp 31.9°C, significantly warmer than indoor (~26–27°C). Increasing OA too much will add sensible load, requiring more coil and/or fan power.
- Current OA damper = 0.35 (moderate). Raising it will cool CO2 but worsen cooling load. However, we already have moderate coil/fan levels; a small OA increase plus balanced supply may reduce CO2 enough without substantially increasing cooling valve (we can slightly reduce coil to balance load).

4) Current actuators and implications:
- Previous:
  - Zone dampers: [0.78, 0.75, 0.67, 0.68]
  - OA damper: 0.35
  - Coil valve: 0.48
  - Fan speed: 0.54
- These values have held temps stable and CO2 slightly rising in some zones. We want:
  - Slightly more ventilation and flow to Zone 1 (high CO2) and Zones 2–3 (near target) without overcooling.
  - Possibly a slight reduction in Zone 4 flow (already cooling with low CO2) to save fan energy and reduce overcooling risk.
  - Keep fan near current level (0.54) to avoid energy surge, but enough to support ventilation.
  - Coil: with OA increased, mixed air temp will rise; we can keep coil around current to avoid warming zones, but not increase it to limit energy.

5) Zone damper strategy:
- Zone 1: Highest CO2 and at comfort center (26.0). Increase damper modestly to improve both cooling buffer and CO2 dilution.
- Zone 2: Slightly warm and rising CO2 but still below target; keep similar or slightly higher to avoid further warming.
- Zone 3: Warmest except Z4 and CO2 just below 1000; keep similar or slightly higher.
- Zone 4: Warmest at 26.8°C but trending down, and CO2 is lowest and decreasing. However, if we cut its air too much, temp could stall above center though still in band. Given its slight cooling trend and strong ventilation already, we can trim a bit to reallocate airflow/energy.
- Chosen adjustments (small to avoid oscillations):
  - Z1: 0.78 → 0.82 (more ventilation for high CO2, slight extra cooling capacity).
  - Z2: 0.75 → 0.77 (maintain comfort, improve CO2 slightly).
  - Z3: 0.67 → 0.70 (help cooling and CO2 a bit).
  - Z4: 0.68 → 0.62 (reduce flow where CO2 is lowest and temp is slowly dropping, saving fan energy).

6) OA damper strategy:
- Z1 is above CO2 target and rising; Z2–3 near target; Z4 comfortable.
- A modest OA increase should improve building-wide CO2 without huge cooling penalty.
- Move OA damper from 0.35 → 0.40 (still far below max 0.6), balancing CO2 reward and energy cost.

7) Coil valve strategy:
- Increasing OA raises mixed-air temperature, which would warm zones if coil is kept too low; but zones are within band and not cooling rapidly, and we don’t want to drive temps down toward 25°C aggressively.
- Keeping coil near current 0.48 should roughly maintain conditions given small OA and damper tweaks. Reducing it significantly risks zones drifting warm above 27 in later intervals, while increasing it costs energy and might overcool.
- Keep coil at 0.48 (no change) for stability and energy-conscious control.

8) Fan speed strategy:
- Fan currently at 0.54 (just above minimum 0.45). Increasing it would improve distribution and CO2 but cost fan energy (power_weight=0.2). Since we’re already slightly increasing OA and some zone dampers, we can maintain fan speed to avoid extra power.
- Leaving fan at 0.54 keeps airflow reasonably stable while still benefiting from damper changes.

9) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers: all between [0.05, 1.0] → [0.82, 0.77, 0.70, 0.62] valid.
- OA damper: 0.40 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.48 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.54 within [0.45, 1.4].

10) Expected outcome next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures remain within 25–27°C, with slight cooling or stability due to steadied coil and redistribution of air.
- CO2, especially in Zone 1, should trend down or at least flatten due to higher OA and increased Z1 damper, reducing co2_penalty and staying well below violation threshold.
- Energy: coil and fan unchanged; only slightly more OA and modest redistribution of dampers, which should keep total power reasonably low while improving the reward via better CO2 and maintained comfort.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.82, 0.77, 0.7, 0.62], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.48, ""fan_speed"": 0.54}","{

- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps:
  • Z1: 26.0°C (perfect, stable)
  • Z2: 26.3°C (slightly warm, stable)
  • Z3: 26.5°C (warm side, stable)
  • Z4: 26.8°C (near upper comfort edge, stable)
- All temp_deltas ≈ 0 → current control roughly balancing loads; no strong drift.
- Outdoor: 31.8°C and slightly cooling but still much hotter than indoors → outdoor air adds heat load.

CO₂:
- Z1: 1005 ppm, slightly above 1000 target, trending down (-0.4 ppm/min → about -2 ppm over 5 min).
- Z2: 957 ppm, below target, trending down.
- Z3: 968 ppm, below target, trending down.
- Z4: 832 ppm, well below, trending down.
- No zone near 1100 ppm violation threshold. Only Z1 is marginally above 1000 but already decreasing.

Energy:
- Previous actions:
  • Zone dampers: [0.82, 0.77, 0.70, 0.62]
  • OA damper: 0.40 (relatively high given hot outdoor air)
  • Coil valve: 0.48 (moderate cooling)
  • Fan speed: 0.54 (slightly above minimum 0.45)
- Reward penalizes power_kW and also CO₂ & comfort deviations. With temps within band and CO₂ mostly near/below target and decreasing, we can slightly reduce energy as long as we don’t push CO₂ up or temps above 27°C.

2) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Comfort: Zones are acceptable but Z3 & Z4 are warmest. Need to avoid them rising. As outdoor air is hot, additional OA tends to warm supply air and increase cooling load. Better to reduce OA somewhat and rely more on recirculated cool air, while keeping enough OA to keep CO₂ declining or at least flat.
- CO₂: Trends are all negative, even with OA=0.40. We can reduce OA slightly to save energy while likely keeping CO₂ near or below 1000 ppm and well below 1100. Z1 is 1005 but decaying; if OA is slightly reduced, decay may slow but 5 minutes is short and violation penalties are only for >1100 ppm, which is unlikely.
- Fan: 0.54 is modest. Slightly reducing fan speed reduces fan power (fan power roughly ∝ speed³). Since conditions are stable, we can cautiously move closer to minimum, but not at absolute min to avoid stagnation and possible CO₂ uptick.
- Coil valve: With outdoor at 31.8°C and OA damper still reasonably open, we should not reduce cooling much; Z4 is at 26.8°C, very close to 27°C. Any notable reduction in coil valve could push Z4 over 27 in the next interval. Better to keep coil about the same or even very slightly increase to gently pull temps down, but increasing coil also increases chiller power. Given temps are within band and not rising, holding coil roughly constant is prudent for energy and comfort.
- Zone dampers: 
  • Z4 (warmest) at 0.62: could benefit from a small increase to get a bit more cool air without drastically raising fan energy (dampers don’t directly cause much power penalty in this abstraction; main power levers are fan and coil). 
  • Z3 also warmish (26.5°C) at 0.70: small nudge up ok.
  • Z1 (perfect temp but slight CO₂ exceedance at 1005 ppm, trending down): modest damper increase can help flush CO₂ without raising system-wide OA fraction; this uses more recirculated air from AHU; global OA fraction we handle via OA damper.
  • Z2: slightly warm but fine; already at 0.77, can hold.

3) Concrete adjustments (relative to previous):
- OA damper: Reduce slightly to cut hot fresh air load but keep good ventilation. From 0.40 → 0.35.
- Fan speed: Reduce cautiously to lower fan power but maintain ventilation & comfort. From 0.54 → 0.50 (still above min 0.45, small step).
- Coil valve: Keep nearly constant; maybe a tiny reduction would risk warming Z4. Given Z4 at 26.8 and OA still introducing heat, best is to hold at 0.48 so as not to jeopardize comfort. So 0.48 unchanged.
- Zone dampers:
  • Z1: 0.82 → 0.85 to support CO₂ dilution and maintain 26°C.
  • Z2: hold at 0.77; fine balance.
  • Z3: 0.70 → 0.73 for slightly more cooling.
  • Z4: 0.62 → 0.66 for slightly more cooling.
- These are small, smooth changes to avoid oscillations while improving warm zones and controlling Z1 CO₂ locally instead of via global OA.

4) Bounds check:
- Zone damper bounds [0.05, 1.0]: proposed 0.85, 0.77, 0.73, 0.66 are all in range.
- OA damper bounds [0.05, 0.6]: 0.35 is in range.
- Coil valve bounds [0.06, 1.0]: 0.48 is in range.
- Fan speed bounds [0.45, 1.4]: 0.50 is in range.

5) Expected effect over next 5 minutes:
- Slightly more air to warmer zones and to Z1 improves comfort and maintains or lowers CO₂ locally.
- Slight reduction in OA lowers cooling load and chiller/fan energy, while CO₂ likely remains below violation threshold and near target since trends were already negative.
- Slight fan speed reduction yields energy savings with modest impact on zone flows given dampers are somewhat more open in critical zones.
- Overall, this should maintain comfort within band, keep CO₂ below 1100 and close to 1000, and slightly reduce power → improving reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.77, 0.73, 0.66], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.48, ""fan_speed"": 0.5}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret state vs objectives:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps:
  • Z1: 26.0°C (perfect)
  • Z2: 26.3°C (+0.3, slightly warm but within band)
  • Z3: 26.5°C (+0.5, warm side, within band)
  • Z4: 26.8°C (+0.8, near upper edge 27°C)
- Temperature trends are ~0°C/min — stable, so current cooling roughly matches loads.
- Outdoor: 31.7°C, still significantly hotter than indoors, so more OA raises cooling load.

- CO2:
  • Z1: 1014 ppm, rising 1.7 ppm/min → in 5 min ≈ 1022 ppm (above 1000 target, below 1100 violation).
  • Z2: 964 ppm, +1.2 ppm/min → ~970 ppm.
  • Z3: 971 ppm, +0.7 ppm/min → ~975 ppm.
  • Z4: 834 ppm, +0.4 ppm/min → ~836 ppm.
- Only Zone 1 is already above 1000 ppm, but still comfortably below the 1100 ppm violation threshold.

2) Previous actuators:
- Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.77, 0.73, 0.66]
- OA damper: 0.35 (moderate outside air)
- Coil valve: 0.48 (moderate cooling)
- Fan speed: 0.50 (near minimum 0.45)

System appears to be in a balanced state: temperatures stable in band, CO2 near target, modest energy use. The reward trades off small comfort/CO2 penalties against power. Any larger moves risk overshooting temperatures (too cold) or consuming more energy.

3) CO2 vs OA & fan:
- Increasing OA and/or fan speed improves CO2 but raises fan/pump/chiller energy and can increase zone temps because OA is 31.7°C.
- Z1 CO2 is just slightly above 1000 and rising slowly; we are far from the 1100 violation penalty. A gentle nudge to improve ventilation is safer than aggressive changes.

4) Thermal vs coil/fan:
- Z4 is closest to the upper comfort limit (26.8°C). If OA is increased too much without extra cooling, Z4 could drift above 27°C.
- Current coil 0.48 seems to hold temps flat. A major increase in cooling would push zones below 26°C, causing comfort penalties for being off center and higher chiller power.
- Fan at 0.50 is already close to minimum; lowering to 0.45 gives marginal power savings but might worsen CO2 slightly and shift air distribution. Given Zone 1’s high CO2, better to keep 0.50.

5) Zone-level strategy:
- Z1: highest CO2 and at 26.0°C. Slightly more airflow to this zone can help dilute CO2 without changing whole-system power much.
- Z2 & Z3: slightly warm but fine; their CO2 is under target but near it. Keep airflow similar or slightly tweak.
- Z4: warmest zone (26.8°C) yet low CO2. It doesn’t need extra fresh air for CO2, but it does need cooling. However, trimming its damper too much reduces its cooling, risking >27°C. So only very minor reduction if any.

6) Decide changes (small, incremental to avoid oscillation):
- OA damper: Increase very slightly from 0.35 → 0.37. This improves ventilation building-wide, particularly helpful for Z1, with modest energy/cooling cost.
- Coil valve: Keep at 0.48. Temperatures are stable; we don’t want to overcool in response to a slight OA increase. Additional load from a +0.02 OA change is small, so 0.48 should still maintain near-flat temps.
- Fan speed: Keep at 0.50. Increasing would improve CO2 but costs fan and chiller power; decreasing could worsen CO2 in Z1. 0.50 is a good compromise.
- Zone dampers:
  • Z1: 0.85 → 0.88 (+0.03) to give it a bit more supply air, improving CO2 and holding temp well at 26°C.
  • Z2: 0.77 → 0.76 (–0.01) tiny reduction, it is slightly warm but close to setpoint; balancing against slight global OA increase.
  • Z3: 0.73 → 0.73 (unchanged). Its temp and CO2 are acceptable.
  • Z4: 0.66 → 0.65 (–0.01) very small reduction to modestly bias air toward Zone 1 while not starving Z4 (already 26.8°C and needs cooling). The change is small enough to avoid pushing it above 27°C in 5 minutes, especially as coil power unchanged.

7) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers must be [0.05, 1.0]: [0.88, 0.76, 0.73, 0.65] are all within bounds.
- OA damper [0.05, 0.6]: 0.37 is within bounds.
- Coil valve [0.06, 1.0]: 0.48 is within bounds.
- Fan speed [0.45, 1.4]: 0.50 is within bounds.

This action slightly improves CO2 (especially in Zone 1), maintains temps in the comfort band around 26°C, and adds only a small energy penalty, which should improve overall reward compared to doing nothing or making aggressive changes.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.76, 0.73, 0.65], ""oa_damper"": 0.37, ""coil_valve"": 0.48, ""fan_speed"": 0.5}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1. Objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy (fan/chiller/pump) while staying within comfort and IAQ constraints.

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 26.0°C (perfect), trend 0°C/min, CO2 1019 ppm with +0.9 ppm/min.
- Zone 2: 26.3°C (+0.3°C within band), CO2 968 ppm rising 0.8 ppm/min.
- Zone 3: 26.5°C (+0.5°C, still good), CO2 973 ppm rising 0.3 ppm/min.
- Zone 4: 26.8°C (+0.8°C, near upper band but acceptable), CO2 835 ppm rising 0.1 ppm/min.

Outdoor: 31.4°C, trending cooler but still significantly hotter than indoor; outside air brings cooling load, not free cooling.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.76, 0.73, 0.65]
- OA damper: 0.37
- Coil valve: 0.48
- Fan speed: 0.50

2. CO2 and IAQ reasoning:
- Zone 1 is already above the 1000 ppm target (1019 ppm) and still rising. Over the next 5 minutes, at +0.9 ppm/min, it would go up roughly ~4–5 ppm if conditions stay similar, still close to threshold and moving in wrong direction.
- Zones 2 and 3 are high but below target, also rising.
- To avoid CO2 inching toward the violation threshold later and to reduce immediate CO2 penalty, we should slightly increase ventilation effectiveness.

Levers for CO2:
- OA damper: increasing OA increases fresh air but also cooling load because outdoor air is hot.
- Fan speed: increasing moves more air, improving zone ventilation rates (but increases fan power).
- Zone dampers: can modulate distribution, but not the total outdoor air intake.

Given we are only modestly above CO2 target in Zone 1 and others are near target, a modest increase in OA damper is preferable to a big fan speed jump, to balance energy vs IAQ.

3. Thermal comfort and cooling load reasoning:
- All zones are within 26±1°C and trends are ~0°C/min, so system is roughly in thermal steady state.
- Outdoor is 31.4°C, so bringing more OA increases cooling load, which might slightly warm supply air if coil valve and/or fan are not adjusted.
- Current coil valve: 0.48 (moderate cooling). Fan speed at minimum bound 0.50 keeps energy low.

Tradeoffs:
- If we raise OA to improve CO2, supply air temperature tends to increase unless we increase coil valve. That could push some zones above 27°C, incurring comfort penalty.
- However, zones are in mid- to upper band, so we can slightly increase coil valve to maintain or nudge temperatures marginally cooler while OA is increased.

4. Strategy for next 5 minutes:
Goals:
- Bring Zone 1 CO2 back closer to or below 1000 ppm.
- Keep all zones in 25–27°C band, ideally near 26°C, without overcooling.
- Keep energy low by not overusing fan speed or coil valve.

Planned actions:
- OA damper: Increase moderately from 0.37 to about 0.42. This improves ventilation and CO2 control without a large extra load.
- Fan speed: Keep at minimum 0.50 to minimize fan energy. We rely on OA fraction change instead of a large airflow increase.
- Coil valve: Slightly increase from 0.48 to about 0.52 to compensate for the slightly warmer mixed air from higher OA. This should keep zone temps stable or slightly cooler but still within the comfort band.
- Zone dampers: Slight redistribution to favor Zone 1 and slightly temper flow to cooler/less CO2-constrained zones while staying close to previous settings to avoid oscillations and excess fan power due to duct pressure changes.

Zone-by-zone adjustments:
- Zone 1 (temp perfect, CO2 high): Slightly increase damper to improve ventilation → from 0.88 to ~0.90.
- Zone 2 (slightly warm, CO2 highish): Keep damper similar or very slightly higher to maintain comfort and IAQ → from 0.76 to 0.77.
- Zone 3 (26.5°C, CO2 973): Slightly warm, but not critical; keep damper about same, maybe very slightly reduced to bias more flow to Zone 1 while staying comfortable → from 0.73 to 0.72.
- Zone 4 (26.8°C, lowest CO2): Warmest temp but also lowest CO2. Lowering damper slightly reduces both cooling and ventilation; because CO2 is fine and temp is at upper band, we don't want to cut too much cooling. So make only a very small reduction, counting on slightly cooler supply air from increased coil valve → from 0.65 to 0.64.

These are small, incremental moves that should keep system near steady state in temperature, with modest IAQ improvement and limited extra energy. All values must be clipped within bounds, which they already satisfy.

5. Final chosen setpoints (within bounds):
- zone_dampers: [0.90, 0.77, 0.72, 0.64]
- oa_damper: 0.42
- coil_valve: 0.52
- fan_speed: 0.50

These settings aim to improve CO2 in Zone 1 and keep others safe while maintaining comfort and constraining energy use.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.77, 0.72, 0.64], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 0.52, ""fan_speed"": 0.5}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret current state vs objectives:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- Zone temps: Z1 26.0 (perfect), Z2 26.3, Z3 26.5, Z4 26.8 (all within band, slightly warm but acceptable; Z4 is closest to upper edge).
- CO₂: Z1 1016 ppm (above 1000 target but below 1100 violation), Z2 966, Z3 970, Z4 832 ppm. All CO₂ trends are slightly negative (CO₂ decreasing already).
- Outdoor: 31.2°C, trending down but still much hotter than indoor; extra OA will increase sensible load and chiller/fan power.
- Previous actuators: zone dampers [0.90, 0.77, 0.72, 0.64], OA damper 0.42, coil 0.52, fan 0.50.

2) Key trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are in a good range; only mild cooling is needed, mainly to stop Z4 from drifting higher and to gently pull Z2/Z3 toward 26.
- Z1 CO₂ is above the 1000 ppm target but is already decreasing at -0.5 ppm/min. Over 5 minutes, that’s ~2.5 ppm reduction, so it will remain just above 1013 ppm if conditions stay similar. That still incurs some CO₂ penalty, but increasing OA would raise cooling (and probably fan) energy significantly due to 31°C outdoor air.
- There is no imminent risk of crossing the 1100 ppm violation threshold (we are ~84 ppm below and trending down).
- Thus, it is likely better for reward to accept a modest CO₂ penalty rather than spend extra power to drive it below 1000 ppm right now.

3) Strategy:
- Maintain similar overall cooling capacity, maybe very slightly increased, to keep all zones stable or gently nudge them cooler while staying near 26°C.
- Slightly increase cooling delivery to the warmest zone (Z4) by increasing its damper a bit.
- Slightly reduce dampers to zones that are already close to setpoint or where we can redistribute some airflow (e.g., Z1 and Z2), but keep within reasonable range to avoid large transients.
- Keep OA damper at or slightly below current to avoid extra outdoor heat load, since CO₂ is not critical and trending down.
- Keep fan speed at its minimum bound (0.45–1.4) to save fan energy, given moderate load and adequate current performance, or very close to previous (0.50). Since bounds allow 0.45 and lower fan speed reduces power without clearly harming comfort or CO₂ for a 5-minute step (damper positions and existing trends look adequate), choose 0.45.
- Coil valve: keep around current 0.52, perhaps a tiny nudge up to compensate for slightly reduced OA (cooler coil to help zones drift gently toward 26 without overshooting). However, since all zones are within band and we are not trying to aggressively cool, keep coil roughly constant to avoid excess energy; minor adjustment not strictly needed.

4) Concrete setpoint decisions:
- Zone 1: Temp 26.0, CO₂ 1016 (highest). We do not want to overcool or over-ventilate. Slightly reduce damper from 0.90 to 0.85 to modestly cut airflow and fan load (and avoid over-prioritizing this zone, which is already at setpoint). CO₂ will likely continue to decline due to building-level ventilation and other zones.
- Zone 2: 26.3°C, slightly warm but fine. Keep similar or slightly lower than before because we want to free some air for Z4. Reduce from 0.77 to 0.75.
- Zone 3: 26.5°C, warmer than Z2 but still well within band. Maintain airflow to slowly bring it down: keep damper around 0.72 (unchanged) to not disturb balance.
- Zone 4: 26.8°C, closest to the 27°C limit. Increase damper a bit from 0.64 to 0.70 to give more cooling airflow and prevent exceeding 27°C.

- OA damper: Currently 0.42. Since outdoor is 31.2°C and CO₂ trends are already negative with Z1 only slightly above target, reduce OA a bit to save chiller energy while still providing significant ventilation. Drop to 0.38; this is still comfortably above minimum 0.05 but reduces outdoor load. Over 5 minutes this should not reverse the downward CO₂ trend significantly, given all zones already trending down.

- Coil valve: Currently 0.52. With fan slightly reduced and OA slightly reduced (less hot air), we can keep coil at 0.52 to maintain similar net cooling capacity per unit airflow. This should gently cool Z3/Z4 and hold Z1/Z2 around target without overshooting. So set coil_valve = 0.52.

- Fan speed: Bounds are 0.45–1.4, previous 0.50. To minimize energy while comfort and CO₂ are safe, lower to the minimum 0.45. Combined with modest damper positions (none extremely low), static pressure and airflow should still be adequate to maintain conditions over 5 minutes.

5) Check against bounds and goals:
- Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.75, 0.72, 0.70] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.38 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.52 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.45 within [0.45, 1.4].

These choices aim to: keep temperatures within 25–27°C, gently cool the warmest zone, allow CO₂ to continue trending down without extra ventilation cost, and reduce fan and chiller energy, thereby improving the composite reward.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.75, 0.72, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.52, ""fan_speed"": 0.45}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1. Objectives and current state:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: < 1000 ppm; violation at > 1100 ppm.
- Minimise energy (fan + chiller via coil valve + pumps).

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 26.0°C (perfect), CO2 1020 ppm (already above 1000, slightly rising).
- Zone 2: 26.3°C (+0.3 above target but in band), CO2 973 ppm, rising 1.4 ppm/min.
- Zone 3: 26.5°C (+0.5 above target, still well in band), CO2 981 ppm, rising 2.1 ppm/min.
- Zone 4: 26.8°C (+0.8, near upper edge but still < 27), CO2 832 ppm, almost flat.

Outdoor air: 31.2°C, warmer than zones, so more OA helps CO2 but hurts cooling load.
Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.85, 0.75, 0.72, 0.70]
- OA damper: 0.38
- Coil valve: 0.52
- Fan speed: 0.45 (minimum allowed).

2. Key trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures are all inside the 25–27°C comfort band, with center errors between 0 and +0.8°C. No urgent need for strong additional cooling, but Zone 4 is close to 27°C.
- CO2 is the more pressing constraint: Zone 1 is above the 1000 ppm target; Zones 2 and 3 are close and rising relatively quickly. Without action, Zones 1–3 could move further above 1000, increasing CO2 penalties and possibly approaching the 1100 ppm violation threshold over subsequent intervals.
- Energy: Fan is already at minimum (0.45) and cannot be reduced further within bounds. Coil at 0.52 is moderate; given outdoor 31.2°C, we need some cooling to prevent zones from drifting higher when we increase outdoor air for CO2.

3. CO2-focused strategy:
- To reduce CO2, two main levers: increase total outdoor-air fraction (OA damper) and/or increase airflow through high-CO2 zones (zone dampers), but the latter is limited by fixed fan speed.
- Since fan speed is at minimum and cannot be lowered to save energy, we can safely reallocate some airflow.
- Zone-level priorities for ventilation:
  - Zone 1: highest CO2 (1020 ppm) → needs more fresh air.
  - Zone 3: next highest (981 ppm, rising fastest) → also a priority.
  - Zone 2: 973 ppm, rising → moderate priority.
  - Zone 4: CO2 healthy (832 ppm) → can afford slightly less fraction of airflow.

Thus, we will:
- Slightly increase OA damper to improve CO2 across all zones, but not to the maximum to avoid excessive cooling load given hot outdoor air.
- Rebalance zone dampers to favor Zones 1–3, especially 1 and 3, while trimming Zone 4 slightly.

4. Thermal comfort considerations:
- Increasing OA with 31.2°C air would tend to warm supply air if mixed, but the cooling coil can offset this.
- Given zones are already slightly on the warm side of 26°C, a modest increase in coil valve can both maintain or slightly lower zone temps while allowing some extra OA for CO2 control.
- We must avoid overcooling: zone temps are in band and we want to stay around 26°C, not push toward 25°C.

5. Concrete adjustments:
Fan speed:
- Bound: [0.45, 1.4]. Currently 0.45.
- To minimize energy, keep at 0.45 (minimum). There is no comfort/CO2 requirement forcing us to increase fan speed since we can adjust OA fraction and dampers.
- Decision: fan_speed = 0.45.

Outdoor-air damper:
- Bound: [0.05, 0.6]. Currently 0.38.
- CO2 in Zone 1 already above 1000, others near. A moderate increase will improve dilution without extreme energy penalty. Going all the way to 0.6 would significantly increase load with 31.2°C OA; a smaller step is more efficient and less likely to overshoot temps.
- Choose a moderate bump: e.g., from 0.38 → 0.46 (~+8 percentage points). This should materially improve CO2 while keeping coil duty manageable.
- Decision: oa_damper = 0.46 (well within 0.05–0.6).

Cooling coil valve:
- Bound: [0.06, 1.0]. Currently 0.52.
- With slightly higher OA and zones generally on the warm side of 26°C, we need a bit more cooling capacity to avoid zones drifting up toward or over 27°C, especially given outdoor 31.2°C.
- However, we do not need aggressive cooling; we just want to hold or slightly nudge temps downward, particularly for Zone 4 (26.8°C) and modestly for Zones 2–3.
- A small increase from 0.52 to around 0.57 balances comfort and energy: enough to handle added OA heat load without large chiller energy spike.
- Decision: coil_valve = 0.57.

Zone dampers (bounds [0.05, 1.0]):
General approach: keep flows relatively high because fan is minimum and we rely on distribution to direct air where needed. Adjust relative positions:
- Zone 1 (26.0°C, 1020 ppm): top CO2, perfect temperature. Increase damper modestly above 0.85 to give more ventilation and slightly more cooling potential if supply air is cooler. But avoid maxing to limit noise/overventilation. Move to 0.90.
- Zone 2 (26.3°C, 973 ppm, rising): moderate CO2 priority. Keep slightly elevated damper, maybe a small increase from 0.75 to 0.78 for better ventilation and light cooling.
- Zone 3 (26.5°C, 981 ppm, fastest CO2 rise): high priority for CO2 and slight cooling. Increase more than Zone 2; from 0.72 to 0.80.
- Zone 4 (26.8°C, 832 ppm): warmest temperature but lowest CO2. Since we’re increasing coil cooling overall, we don’t need to increase its damper; we can slightly reduce it to free some airflow fraction to other zones while still allowing enough cooling (supply air will be colder after coil increase). Drop from 0.70 to 0.65.

These adjustments should:
- Decrease or at least stabilize CO2 in Zones 1–3 due to more OA and higher relative damper positions.
- Keep temperatures near 26°C or slightly below current levels, especially in Zones 3–4 where temps are on the high side of the band.
- Keep energy relatively contained: fan at minimum, OA only moderately increased, coil only slightly increased to support comfort and CO2 control.

6. Bounds check:
- zone_dampers: [0.90, 0.78, 0.80, 0.65] all within [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.46 within [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve: 0.57 within [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.45 within [0.45, 1.4].

7. Summary:
- Prioritize CO2 reduction for Zones 1–3 via modest OA increase and damper redistribution.
- Slightly increase coil valve to compensate for higher OA and keep zones within and near the 26°C target.
- Keep fan speed at minimum to minimize energy use.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.78, 0.8, 0.65], ""oa_damper"": 0.46, ""coil_valve"": 0.57, ""fan_speed"": 0.45}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort and temps:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C with a center at 26°C.
- Current zone temps:
  - Z1: 26.0°C (perfect)
  - Z2: 26.3°C (+0.3, slightly warm but within band)
  - Z3: 26.5°C (+0.5, warm side of band)
  - Z4: 26.8°C (+0.8, close to upper band edge)
- All temperature trends are 0.0°C/min, so inertia is moderate; with outdoor at 31.3°C and rising, internal temps will drift upward if we reduce cooling too much.
- We want to gently pull Z3 and especially Z4 down toward 26°C without overshooting or using unnecessary power.

2) CO2 conditions:
- Targets: <1000 ppm; violation at >1100 ppm.
- Current CO2:
  - Z1: 1015 ppm, trending down at -0.9 ppm/min → over 5 min, ~-4.5 ppm → about 1010.5 ppm (still slightly over target but improving).
  - Z2: 971 ppm, trending down slightly → will stay below 1000.
  - Z3: 982 ppm, trending up at +0.1 ppm/min → over 5 min, +0.5 ppm → ~982.5 ppm, still under 1000.
  - Z4: 828 ppm, trending down further → well below target.
- Peak CO2 is modestly above 1000 only in Z1 and trending down already; no risk of hitting 1100 threshold. So we should not significantly increase OA or fan just for CO2; keep enough ventilation to keep trends non-worsening.

3) Current actuators and bounds:
- Previous:
  - Zone dampers: [0.90, 0.78, 0.80, 0.65]
  - OA damper: 0.46 (bounds 0.05–0.60)
  - Coil valve: 0.57 (bounds 0.06–1.0)
  - Fan speed: 0.45 (bounds 0.45–1.40)
- We must stay within these bounds. Fan is at minimum; we cannot reduce it further, so fan power is already minimized.

4) Strategy trade-offs:
- Reducing chiller (coil valve) lowers power but risks zones drifting warmer, especially Z3 and Z4, which are already on the warm side.
- OA damper affects ventilation load and CO2. Given moderate CO2 and an outdoor temperature higher than inside (31.3°C vs ~26°C), extra OA is energy-costly and tends to warm supply air. We want OA just high enough to keep CO2 trending acceptably.
- Zone dampers distribute the available cool air. Increasing damper for warmer/higher-CO2 zones and slightly reducing for cooler/lower-load zones can improve comfort and CO2 without increasing central plant power.

5) CO2 and OA decision:
- Z1 is slightly above 1000 but falling; others are below 1000 or near and not rising fast.
- OA at 0.46 is quite high given 0.05–0.60 range; this likely increases cooling load without strong CO2 benefit beyond a point.
- We can modestly reduce OA to cut load while watching that CO2 doesn’t trend upward too quickly. A small step down to ~0.40 keeps substantial ventilation and should still maintain or slowly reduce CO2, given fan is constant and dampers remain mostly open.

6) Coil valve decision (cooling level):
- Outdoor is hot and rising; we’re late afternoon, so internal and solar gains are likely significant.
- All zones are at or above 26°C with some reaching close to 27°C; we should not reduce cooling capacity right now. A slight increase can gently pull temps down toward 26, especially because fan speed cannot be raised above 0.45 without extra fan power.
- To balance energy and comfort, a modest bump of coil valve from 0.57 to about 0.60 is reasonable: more cooling, but not dramatically more chiller power.

7) Zone damper decisions:
- Goal: prioritize airflow for warmer zones (Z3, Z4) and somewhat for higher CO2 zones (Z1, Z3), while trimming slightly from cooler/less demanding zones.
- Starting values: [0.90, 0.78, 0.80, 0.65]
- Z4 (26.8°C, 828 ppm): warmest, low CO2 → needs more cooling. Increase damper moderately, say from 0.65 to 0.72.
- Z3 (26.5°C, 982 ppm, slightly rising CO2): warm and near CO2 target → increase damper a bit, e.g., from 0.80 to 0.84.
- Z1 (26.0°C, 1015 ppm trending down): thermally fine but slightly above CO2 target; maintain or very slightly reduce cooling air, but not too much or CO2 removal might slow. Keep near current or tiny reduction; choose 0.88 (from 0.90) to share more air with Z3/Z4 without meaningfully hurting ventilation.
- Z2 (26.3°C, 971 ppm, decreasing CO2): comfortable and safe CO2 → can give up a bit of air to favor Z3/Z4. Reduce from 0.78 to 0.74.
- All these remain within [0.05, 1.0]. Changes are incremental to avoid oscillations.

8) Fan speed decision:
- Already at minimum (0.45) and bounded below by 0.45; cannot reduce for energy savings.
- Increasing fan speed would increase power and may be unnecessary because we’re slightly increasing coil and rebalancing dampers; we’ll keep fan speed at 0.45.

9) Final check vs objectives:
- Comfort: Slightly more coil and increased dampers for warmer zones should pull Z3 and Z4 down toward 26°C while keeping Z1 and Z2 inside comfort band.
- CO2: OA slightly reduced but still reasonably high, with stronger flow in Z3 and maintained in Z1; CO2 should remain below violation levels and close to or under 1000 ppm on average.
- Power: Fan is at minimum; OA is reduced (less load) and coil increase is modest. Net effect should be acceptable given the comfort and CO2 constraints.

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Comfort and temps:\n- Comfort band is 25–27°C with a center at 26°C.\n- Current zone temps:\n  - Z1: 26.0°C (perfect)\n  - Z2: 26.3°C (+0.3, slightly warm but within band)\n  - Z3: 26.5°C (+0.5, warm side of band)\n  - Z4: 26.8°C (+0.8, close to upper band edge)\n- All temperature trends are 0.0°C/min, so inertia is moderate; with outdoor at 31.3°C and rising, internal temps will drift upward if we reduce cooling too much.\n- We want to gently pull Z3 and especially Z4 down toward 26°C without overshooting or using unnecessary power.\n\n2) CO2 conditions:\n- Targets: <1000 ppm; violation at >1100 ppm.\n- Current CO2:\n  - Z1: 1015 ppm, trending down at -0.9 ppm/min → over 5 min, ~-4.5 ppm → about 1010.5 ppm (still slightly over target but improving).\n  - Z2: 971 ppm, trending down slightly → will stay below 1000.\n  - Z3: 982 ppm, trending up at +0.1 ppm/min → over 5 min, +0.5 ppm → ~982.5 ppm, still under 1000.\n  - Z4: 828 ppm, trending down further → well below target.\n- Peak CO2 is modestly above 1000 only in Z1 and trending down already; no risk of hitting 1100 threshold. So we should not significantly increase OA or fan just for CO2; keep enough ventilation to keep trends non-worsening.\n\n3) Current actuators and bounds:\n- Previous:\n  - Zone dampers: [0.90, 0.78, 0.80, 0.65]\n  - OA damper: 0.46 (bounds 0.05–0.60)\n  - Coil valve: 0.57 (bounds 0.06–1.0)\n  - Fan speed: 0.45 (bounds 0.45–1.40)\n- We must stay within these bounds. Fan is at minimum; we cannot reduce it further, so fan power is already minimized.\n\n4) Strategy trade-offs:\n- Reducing chiller (coil valve) lowers power but risks zones drifting warmer, especially Z3 and Z4, which are already on the warm side.\n- OA damper affects ventilation load and CO2. Given moderate CO2 and an outdoor temperature higher than inside (31.3°C vs ~26°C), extra OA is energy-costly and tends to warm supply air. We want OA just high enough to keep CO2 trending acceptably.\n- Zone dampers distribute the available cool air. Increasing damper for warmer/higher-CO2 zones and slightly reducing for cooler/lower-load zones can improve comfort and CO2 without increasing central plant power.\n\n5) CO2 and OA decision:\n- Z1 is slightly above 1000 but falling; others are below 1000 or near and not rising fast.\n- OA at 0.46 is quite high given 0.05–0.60 range; this likely increases cooling load without strong CO2 benefit beyond a point.\n- We can modestly reduce OA to cut load while watching that CO2 doesn’t trend upward too quickly. A small step down to ~0.40 keeps substantial ventilation and should still maintain or slowly reduce CO2, given fan is constant and dampers remain mostly open.\n\n6) Coil valve decision (cooling level):\n- Outdoor is hot and rising; we’re late afternoon, so internal and solar gains are likely significant.\n- All zones are at or above 26°C with some reaching close to 27°C; we should not reduce cooling capacity right now. A slight increase can gently pull temps down toward 26, especially because fan speed cannot be raised above 0.45 without extra fan power.\n- To balance energy and comfort, a modest bump of coil valve from 0.57 to about 0.60 is reasonable: more cooling, but not dramatically more chiller power.\n\n7) Zone damper decisions:\n- Goal: prioritize airflow for warmer zones (Z3, Z4) and somewhat for higher CO2 zones (Z1, Z3), while trimming slightly from cooler/less demanding zones.\n- Starting values: [0.90, 0.78, 0.80, 0.65]\n- Z4 (26.8°C, 828 ppm): warmest, low CO2 → needs more cooling. Increase damper moderately, say from 0.65 to 0.72.\n- Z3 (26.5°C, 982 ppm, slightly rising CO2): warm and near CO2 target → increase damper a bit, e.g., from 0.80 to 0.84.\n- Z1 (26.0°C, 1015 ppm trending down): thermally fine but slightly above CO2 target; maintain or very slightly reduce cooling air, but not too much or CO2 removal might slow. Keep near current or tiny reduction; choose 0.88 (from 0.90) to share more air with Z3/Z4 without meaningfully hurting ventilation.\n- Z2 (26.3°C, 971 ppm, decreasing CO2): comfortable and safe CO2 → can give up a bit of air to favor Z3/Z4. Reduce from 0.78 to 0.74.\n- All these remain within [0.05, 1.0]. Changes are incremental to avoid oscillations.\n\n8) Fan speed decision:\n- Already at minimum (0.45) and bounded below by 0.45; cannot reduce for energy savings.\n- Increasing fan speed would increase power and may be unnecessary because we’re slightly increasing coil and rebalancing dampers; we’ll keep fan speed at 0.45.\n\n9) Final check vs objectives:\n- Comfort: Slightly more coil and increased dampers for warmer zones should pull Z3 and Z4 down toward 26°C while keeping Z1 and Z2 inside comfort band.\n- CO2: OA slightly reduced but still reasonably high, with stronger flow in Z3 and maintained in Z1; CO2 should remain below violation levels and close to or under 1000 ppm on average.\n- Power: Fan is at minimum; OA is reduced (less load) and coil increase is modest. Net effect should be acceptable given the comfort and CO2 constraints.\n\n10) Apply bounds and finalize: All actions are within specified ranges; no clipping needed."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret objectives and current state:
- Comfort: target 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2: target < 1000 ppm, violation > 1100 ppm.
- Energy: penalized via fan/chiller/pump power, so avoid unnecessarily high fan_speed / coil_valve / OA.

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T = 26.0°C (perfect), CO2 = 1018 ppm (above 1000, slightly rising +0.5 ppm/min).
- Zone 2: T = 26.4°C (slightly warm but within band), CO2 = 977 ppm (below 1000 but rising +1.2 ppm/min).
- Zone 3: T = 26.5°C (slightly warm), CO2 = 987 ppm (just below 1000, rising +0.9 ppm/min).
- Zone 4: T = 26.8°C (upper edge of comfort band), CO2 = 828 ppm (comfortably low, slightly decreasing).

Outdoor: 31.1°C and trending down but still significantly hotter than setpoint, so additional outdoor air increases cooling load.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.74, 0.84, 0.72]
- OA damper: 0.40 (on 0.05–0.6 range)
- Coil valve: 0.60 (moderate cooling)
- Fan speed: 0.45 (at minimum allowed)

2) Anticipate next 5 minutes:
CO2 projection (linear extrapolation over 5 min):
- Zone 1: 1018 + 0.5*5 ≈ 1020.5 ppm (still above target but far from 1100).
- Zone 2: 977 + 1.2*5 ≈ 983 ppm (still < 1000 but approaching).
- Zone 3: 987 + 0.9*5 ≈ 991.5 ppm (just under target).
- Zone 4: 828 + (-0.1)*5 ≈ 827.5 ppm (safe).

Temperatures (very small trends currently):
- Zone 1: 26.0°C stable.
- Zone 2: 26.4 + 0.01*5 ≈ 26.45°C (slightly warm but fine).
- Zone 3: 26.5°C stable.
- Zone 4: 26.8°C stable.

Indoor temps are slightly high but within comfort band. Slightly more cooling would move them closer to 26°C, but any increase in cooling/fan will increase energy.

CO2 is near but mostly under 1000 ppm except Zone 1, which is only marginally over and not trending rapidly. Given the penalty design: there’s a continuous CO2 penalty and a large violation penalty at 1100 ppm. We are not close to violation and trend is mild, so an aggressive ventilation increase is likely not worth the energy/cooling penalty over just 5 minutes.

3) Trade-offs:
- Comfort: currently acceptable; a small bump in cooling could better center temps but may not justify power cost for only a 0.3–0.8°C deviation within band.
- CO2: modestly high; we can slightly bias airflow/ventilation toward the higher-CO2 zones without heavily changing fan_speed or OA.
- Energy: fan_speed is already at minimum, so keep it there to minimize fan power.

4) Control strategy by actuator:

(a) Fan speed:
- Lower bound is 0.45 and we are at 0.45.
- Increasing it would improve mixing and CO2 removal per unit time but increases power significantly and will also increase sensible cooling effect (since coil valve is nonzero), possibly overcooling slightly.
- Given comfort and CO2 are acceptable and only moderately drifting, keep fan_speed at minimum 0.45.

(b) Coil valve (cooling capacity):
- At 0.60, zones are slightly above 26°C but stable or only very slow warming.
- A small increase could bring temps closer to 26°C but at cost of more chiller/pump energy.
- Since we are in-band and not showing strong upward temp trends, it’s more energy-efficient to slightly reduce cooling, accepting a minor temp drift but staying <27°C.
- To avoid causing temps to creep out of band, make only a modest decrease, e.g., from 0.60 to about 0.55, which reduces energy use while likely keeping all zones within 25–27°C during the next 5 minutes.

(c) Outdoor air (OA) damper:
- Currently 0.40 on a 0.05–0.6 range.
- CO2 levels are near acceptable and not racing toward violation; projected peaks in 5 minutes remain < 1030 ppm and well below 1100 ppm.
- Reducing OA slightly cuts energy (warmer outdoor air) while not significantly affecting CO2 in such a short interval, since we still maintain substantial OA.
- To avoid sudden changes and maintain ventilation safety margin, pull OA from 0.40 to around 0.35.

(d) Zone dampers (distribution among zones):
Goal: favor zones with higher CO2 (and slightly higher temps) by giving them a bit more airflow, and take slightly from zones with better CO2 and warmer margin, while not changing total fan speed.

Current vs desired priorities:
- Zone 1: CO2 above target (1018), temp ideal at 26.0 → increase damper slightly.
- Zone 2: CO2 below but rising quickly, temp 26.4 → modest increase or maintain.
- Zone 3: CO2 just below 1000, temp 26.5 → maintain or small increase.
- Zone 4: CO2 low, temp 26.8 (high side) → acceptable to slightly reduce to free flow for other zones and limit overcooling.

Adjustments:
- Zone 1: 0.88 → 0.92 (small increase toward upper bound but not max, to avoid excessive bias).
- Zone 2: 0.74 → 0.76 (small bump).
- Zone 3: 0.84 → 0.86 (small bump).
- Zone 4: 0.72 → 0.68 (small reduction since its CO2 is best and temp is near top of band; this also helps avoid overcooling this zone when we still have coil at 0.55).

All damper setpoints remain within [0.05, 1.0]. These modest rebalances should help reduce CO2 in 1–3 where it’s near or above 1000, without extra fan power.

5) Check against bounds and targets:
- zone_dampers: [0.92, 0.76, 0.86, 0.68] ∈ [0.05, 1.0].
- oa_damper: 0.35 ∈ [0.05, 0.6].
- coil_valve: 0.55 ∈ [0.06, 1.0].
- fan_speed: 0.45 ∈ [0.45, 1.4].

These settings aim to:
- Maintain all temps inside 25–27°C with slight energy savings via reduced coil and OA.
- Keep fan at minimum power.
- Slightly favor higher-CO2 zones through damper adjustments to keep CO2 below violation and near target.

6) Final decision:
Use the slightly reduced OA and coil, keep fan at minimum, and re-balance zone dampers toward higher-CO2 zones for the upcoming 5-minute interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.92, 0.76, 0.86, 0.68], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.55, ""fan_speed"": 0.45}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret objectives and current state:
- Comfort: target 26°C, comfort band 25–27°C. All zones are within band:
  • Z1: 26.0°C (perfect)
  • Z2: 26.4°C (slightly warm but fine)
  • Z3: 26.6°C (warmer, still within band)
  • Z4: 26.8°C (near upper band edge)
- CO₂: keep <1000 ppm, strong penalty >1100 ppm.
  • Z1: 1025 ppm (already above target, and rising 1.5 ppm/min → +7.5 ppm in 5 min ≈ 1032 ppm)
  • Z2: 986 ppm, rising 1.7 ppm/min → ≈ 994 ppm (near target)
  • Z3: 996 ppm, rising 1.7 ppm/min → ≈ 1005 ppm (slightly above target soon)
  • Z4: 833 ppm, safe.
- Outdoor: 31°C (hotter than zones), so more OA will increase cooling load and fan power but needed for CO₂.
- Previous actions:
  • Zone dampers: [0.92, 0.76, 0.86, 0.68]
  • OA damper: 0.35
  • Coil valve: 0.55
  • Fan speed: 0.45 (at minimum bound).

2) Key trade-offs for next 5 minutes:
- CO₂ is the primary risk: Z1 is already above 1000 ppm and increasing; Z3 will cross 1000 ppm; Z2 is close. Need more ventilation to reduce CO₂ penalties and avoid violation.
- Temperatures are slightly warm, with Z3 and Z4 near upper band; some extra cooling is acceptable and may even improve comfort, but avoid overshooting much below 26°C.
- Power: increasing OA, fan speed, and coil valve raises power_kw. However, penalties for CO₂ (and especially violation) are significant, so some energy increase is justified.

3) Strategy selection:
- To reduce CO₂: 
  • Increase OA damper moderately to bring in more fresh air.
  • Slightly increase fan speed to deliver more ventilation per zone.
  • Open dampers more for the high-CO₂ zones (1, 2, 3) and avoid over-ventilating low-CO₂ Zone 4.
- To maintain comfort: 
  • Keep or slightly increase coil valve to prevent zones from drifting warmer due to extra OA at 31°C.
  • Since current temps are on the warm side, a bit more cooling is beneficial.
- Keep adjustments modest to limit energy.

4) Zone damper decisions:
- Zone 1 (26.0°C, 1025 ppm, rising): top priority for ventilation, temperature exactly at target.
  • Increase damper slightly above 0.92 to boost fresh air without maxing out. Choose 0.96.
- Zone 2 (26.4°C, 986 ppm → ~994 ppm): near CO₂ target, slightly warm.
  • Increase damper a bit for CO₂ mitigation and mild cooling. From 0.76 to 0.80.
- Zone 3 (26.6°C, 996 ppm → ~1005 ppm): both warmest (with Z4) and crossing CO₂ target.
  • Increase damper modestly for both ventilation and cooling. From 0.86 to 0.90.
- Zone 4 (26.8°C, 833 ppm): low CO₂ but warmest temperature.
  • CO₂ does not require more air; but more supply air (cool) will help temperature. However, more damper flow also costs fan power. Given high temperature and low CO₂, keep damper similar or slightly down to bias air to other zones while using coil for cooling. Keep at 0.66–0.68 range. Slightly reduce from 0.68 to 0.66 to prioritize zones 1–3 and trim airflow a bit.

Chosen zone_dampers: [0.96, 0.80, 0.90, 0.66] (within [0.05, 1.0]).

5) Outdoor air damper decision:
- Current OA damper: 0.35; bounds [0.05, 0.6].
- CO₂ trends call for more OA; but outdoor is 31°C (5°C above setpoint), raising cooling load.
- A moderate increase should materially improve CO₂ within 5 minutes without extreme energy use.
- Increase OA damper from 0.35 to 0.45 (mid-high but not max). This should meaningfully raise fresh air fraction to all zones, reducing CO₂ growth and possibly reversing it.

Chosen oa_damper: 0.45 (clipped to [0.05, 0.6]).

6) Coil valve decision (cooling):
- Current coil valve: 0.55; bounds [0.06, 1.0].
- All zones are at or above 26°C; none are cold. Extra OA at 31°C adds sensible load, so supply air must be cooler to maintain temperatures.
- Slightly increase coil valve to preempt warming and possibly nudge zones slightly closer to center (around 26°C) without overshooting below 25°C.
- Increase coil valve from 0.55 to 0.60, a modest change.

Chosen coil_valve: 0.60 (within bounds).

7) Fan speed decision:
- Current fan speed: 0.45; bounds [0.45, 1.4]. Already at minimum.
- To deliver increased OA fraction and benefit high-CO₂ zones, a small increase in fan speed is helpful.
- Energy cost from 0.45 to ~0.55 is limited and likely outweighed by CO₂ and comfort benefits.
- Choose 0.55 to enhance airflow and distribution without large energy penalty.

Chosen fan_speed: 0.55 (clipped to [0.45, 1.4]).

8) Check joint effects on objectives for next 5 minutes:
- CO₂: Higher OA damper + higher fan speed + more open dampers in Zones 1–3 should reduce or at least stabilize CO₂, lowering penalties and reducing risk of crossing 1100 ppm.
- Comfort: More cooling capacity and airflow should keep or slightly lower zone temperatures. Risk of dropping below 25°C within 5 minutes is very low given current temps and short horizon.
- Power: Increases in OA, coil, fan, and some dampers raise power, but they are moderate and justified by substantial CO₂ and comfort gains within the reward structure.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Key objectives and current state:
- Thermal comfort band: 25–27°C, center 26°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.
- Minimize energy via fan_speed, coil_valve, and damper positions while maintaining comfort & IAQ.

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: T=26.0°C (perfect), dT/dt≈-0.01°C/min (slightly cooling), CO2=1007 ppm (just above 1000, decreasing at -3.3 ppm/min).
- Zone 2: T=26.3°C (slightly warm but within band), dT/dt≈-0.01, CO2=973 ppm (good, slightly decreasing).
- Zone 3: T=26.5°C (mid-upper band), dT/dt≈-0.01, CO2=985 ppm (near target, slightly decreasing).
- Zone 4: T=26.8°C (close to upper band but trend slightly cooling), CO2=827 ppm (good).

Plant/outdoor:
- Outdoor T=30.9°C (significantly hotter than indoor), trending slightly down but still hot.
- Previous action: zone_dampers=[0.96, 0.8, 0.9, 0.66], oa_damper=0.45, coil_valve=0.6, fan_speed=0.55.

2) Comfort implications next 5 minutes:
- Trend dT/dt≈-0.01°C/min ⇒ over 5 minutes, ΔT≈-0.05°C.
  Approx projections:
  - Zone 1: 26.0 → 25.95 (centered, excellent).
  - Zone 2: 26.3 → 26.25 (still slightly warm, ok).
  - Zone 3: 26.5 → 26.45 (upper-middle, ok).
  - Zone 4: 26.8 → 26.75 (still within band but nearer top).
- We do not want to increase cooling; we can slightly reduce coil and/or airflow to save energy while staying within 25–27°C.

3) CO2 implications next 5 minutes:
- Zone 1: 1007 ppm, trend -3.3 ppm/min ⇒ over 5 min, ~-16.5 ppm ⇒ ~990 ppm (back under 1000, well under 1100). Slight buffer but marginal.
- Zone 2: 973 ppm, trend -2.4 ⇒ ≈-12 ⇒ ~961 ppm.
- Zone 3: 985 ppm, trend -2.0 ⇒ ≈-10 ⇒ ~975 ppm.
- Zone 4: 827 ppm, trend -1.2 ⇒ ≈-6 ⇒ ~821 ppm.
- Present OA damper 0.45 and relatively high zone dampers are giving slightly falling CO2 near target. We can modestly reduce OA and fan but must avoid pushing Zone 1 back above 1000 or losing too much ventilation.

4) Energy considerations:
- Energy roughly increases with:
  - Fan power ∝ fan_speed.
  - Chiller/pump ∝ coil_valve * airflow.
  - More OA at hot outdoor temp increases cooling load.
- Current settings are moderate: fan_speed 0.55 (above min 0.45), coil_valve 0.6, OA damper 0.45, large zone dampers.
- We can probably:
  - Slightly reduce coil_valve (comfort has margin and temps are already trending down).
  - Slightly reduce fan_speed (to cut fan kW while keeping CO2 downward trends acceptable).
  - Slightly reduce OA damper to cut latent/sensible load while still maintaining CO2 below 1000 ppm.
  - Slightly trim largest zone dampers where temperature is acceptable to reduce unnecessary flow.

5) Constraints & strategy by actuator:
- Bounds:
  - zone_dampers ∈ [0.05, 1.0].
  - oa_damper ∈ [0.05, 0.6].
  - coil_valve ∈ [0.06, 1.0].
  - fan_speed ∈ [0.45, 1.4].

Zone dampers:
- Zone 1: T perfect, CO2 slightly high but trending down. For CO2 control, we shouldn’t reduce damper too much. From 0.96 we can modestly back off while still providing strong airflow. Example: 0.9.
- Zone 2: Slightly warm but ok, CO2 fine. We can reduce a bit more: from 0.8 to ~0.75.
- Zone 3: Slightly warmish (26.5→26.45) and CO2 near 1000. Keep relatively open to ensure ventilation: maybe small reduction from 0.9 to 0.85.
- Zone 4: Warmest (26.8→26.75) but good CO2. To keep comfort margin at upper band with reduced central cooling, we should not reduce much or might even hold similar. From 0.66 maybe gently down to 0.64 to share energy reduction but still good flow.
- These small reductions will slightly reduce airflow/energy but shouldn’t significantly damage comfort or CO2 trends over 5 minutes.

OA damper:
- From 0.45; outside is much hotter than inside, so OA costs energy.
- CO2 trends show decreasing concentrations at current settings with some margin; we can reduce OA slightly to 0.4 to save on cooling load while likely keeping CO2 still trending down or flat near target. Combined with modest fan reduction, net ventilation might still be adequate because dampers remain high.

Coil valve:
- Current coil_valve 0.6 with zone temps gently declining implies we have cooling headroom.
- Reducing to ~0.5 should keep space within 25–27°C for the next 5 minutes, given only ~0.05°C projected drop and outdoor still hot (so some cooling is needed). This reduces chiller energy but still provides enough latent/sensible capacity, especially with slightly reduced OA.

Fan speed:
- Current fan_speed 0.55; minimum is 0.45.
- To save energy, we can drop modestly, e.g., to 0.5 instead of near-min since CO2 in Zone 1 is barely under target and we’ve already reduced OA a bit. 0.5 maintains decent ventilation rate while trimming fan power.

6) Check interactions and safety margins:
- Temperature: with slightly lower coil_valve and fan_speed, the negative dT/dt might diminish or flatten. That’s actually desirable because temps are within band and some zones near upper band could benefit from slightly less cooling to stay around 26–26.7°C instead of drifting cooler; risk of going above 27°C in 5 minutes is low because outdoor is hot and we’re still providing active cooling.
- CO2: main risk zone is Zone 1. At 1007 ppm trending downward with strong damper (0.9) and fan 0.5, OA 0.4, it’s plausible CO2 stays ~around 1000 or just under without spiking toward 1100. Given violation penalty is large, we avoid any aggressive OA/fan cuts.
- All setpoints remain strictly within provided bounds.

7) Final selected actions (clipped to bounds and expressed as floats):
- zone_dampers: [0.9, 0.75, 0.85, 0.64]
- oa_damper: 0.4
- coil_valve: 0.5
- fan_speed: 0.5

These choices trade a modest energy reduction for still-robust comfort and ventilation, aligning with reward design priorities for this 5-minute horizon.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.75, 0.85, 0.64], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.5}","{""thought_process"": ""1) Key objectives and current state:\n- Thermal comfort band: 25–27°C, center 26°C.\n- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, violation at >1100 ppm.\n- Minimize energy via fan_speed, coil_valve, and damper positions while maintaining comfort & IAQ.\n\nCurrent zone conditions:\n- Zone 1: T=26.0°C (perfect), dT/dt≈-0.01°C/min (slightly cooling), CO2=1007 ppm (just above 1000, decreasing at -3.3 ppm/min).\n- Zone 2: T=26.3°C (slightly warm but within band), dT/dt≈-0.01, CO2=973 ppm (good, slightly decreasing).\n- Zone 3: T=26.5°C (mid-upper band), dT/dt≈-0.01, CO2=985 ppm (near target, slightly decreasing).\n- Zone 4: T=26.8°C (close to upper band but trend slightly cooling), CO2=827 ppm (good).\n\nPlant/outdoor:\n- Outdoor T=30.9°C (significantly hotter than indoor), trending slightly down but still hot.\n- Previous action: zone_dampers=[0.96, 0.8, 0.9, 0.66], oa_damper=0.45, coil_valve=0.6, fan_speed=0.55.\n\n2) Comfort implications next 5 minutes:\n- Trend dT/dt≈-0.01°C/min ⇒ over 5 minutes, ΔT≈-0.05°C.\n  Approx projections:\n  - Zone 1: 26.0 → 25.95 (centered, excellent).\n  - Zone 2: 26.3 → 26.25 (still slightly warm, ok).\n  - Zone 3: 26.5 → 26.45 (upper-middle, ok).\n  - Zone 4: 26.8 → 26.75 (still within band but nearer top).\n- We do not want to increase cooling; we can slightly reduce coil and/or airflow to save energy while staying within 25–27°C.\n\n3) CO2 implications next 5 minutes:\n- Zone 1: 1007 ppm, trend -3.3 ppm/min ⇒ over 5 min, ~-16.5 ppm ⇒ ~990 ppm (back under 1000, well under 1100).

Keep relatively open to ensure ventilation: maybe small reduction from 0.9 to 0.85.\n- Zone 4: Warmest (26.8→26.75) but good CO2. To keep comfort margin at upper band with reduced central cooling, we should not reduce much or might even hold similar. From 0.66 maybe gently down to 0.64 to share energy reduction but still good flow.\n- These small reductions will slightly reduce airflow/energy but shouldn’t significantly damage comfort or CO2 trends over 5 minutes.\n\nOA damper:\n- From 0.45; outside is much hotter than inside, so OA costs energy.\n- CO2 trends show decreasing concentrations at current settings with some margin; we can reduce OA slightly to 0.4 to save on cooling load while likely keeping CO2 still trending down or flat near target. Combined with modest fan reduction, net ventilation might still be adequate because dampers remain high.\n\nCoil valve:\n- Current coil_valve 0.6 with zone temps gently declining implies we have cooling headroom.\n- Reducing to ~0.5 should keep space within 25–27°C for the next 5 minutes, given only ~0.05°C projected drop and outdoor still hot (so some cooling is needed). This reduces chiller energy but still provides enough latent/sensible capacity, especially with slightly reduced OA.\n\nFan speed:\n- Current fan_speed 0.55; minimum is 0.45.\n- To save energy, we can drop modestly, e.g., to 0.5 instead of near-min since CO2 in Zone 1 is barely under target and we’ve already reduced OA a bit. 0.5 maintains decent ventilation rate while trimming fan power.\n\n6) Check interactions and safety margins:\n- Temperature: with slightly lower coil_valve and fan_speed, the negative dT/dt might diminish or flatten. That’s actually desirable because temps are within band and some zones near upper band could benefit from slightly less cooling to stay around 26–26.7°C instead of drifting cooler; risk of going above 27°C in 5 minutes is low because outdoor is hot and we’re still providing active cooling.\n- CO2: main risk zone is Zone 1. At 1007 ppm trending downward with strong damper (0.9) and fan 0.5, OA 0.4, it’s plausible CO2 stays ~around 1000 or just under without spiking toward 1100. Given violation penalty is large, we avoid any aggressive OA/fan cuts.\n- All setpoints remain strictly within provided bounds.\n\n7) Final selected actions (clipped to bounds and expressed as floats):\n- zone_dampers: [0.9, 0.75, 0.85, 0.64]\n- oa_damper: 0.4\n- coil_valve: 0.5\n- fan_speed: 0.5\n\nThese choices trade a modest energy reduction for still-robust comfort and ventilation, aligning with reward design priorities for this 5-minute horizon."", ""action"": {""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.75, 0.85, 0.64], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.5}}",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort & CO2 assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C with center at 26°C. All zones are within band:
  - Zone 1: 26.0°C (ideal)
  - Zone 2: 26.3°C (slightly warm, still within band)
  - Zone 3: 26.5°C (warmer but ok)
  - Zone 4: 26.7°C (near upper band limit; watch but not critical over 5 min)
- CO2:
  - Z1: 1005 ppm, slightly above 1000 target, trending down (-0.5 ppm/min → about -2.5 ppm over 5 min, ending ~1002–1003 ppm)
  - Z2: 974 ppm, trending slowly up (+0.1 ppm/min → +0.5 ppm to ~974–975 ppm)
  - Z3: 985 ppm, trending down slightly (-0.1 ppm/min)
  - Z4: 827 ppm, stable.
- All zones are safely below the 1100 ppm violation threshold. Main concern is keeping Z1/Z2/Z3 from creeping higher, but the trends for Z1/Z3 are already negative.

2) Energy vs. ventilation trade-off:
- Objective: maintain comfort around 26°C, CO2 < 1000 ppm (with heavier penalty above target), and minimise power.
- Outdoor temp is 30.8°C (much warmer than zones), so added outdoor air increases cooling load and fan energy. We should not increase OA unless necessary for CO2.
- With CO2 only slightly over target in Z1 and close to target in Z3, and trends already neutral/negative, a modest increase in OA/fan is enough; no need for aggressive changes that spike power.

3) Evaluate previous action as baseline:
- Previous: zone_dampers = [0.9, 0.75, 0.85, 0.64], oa_damper = 0.4, coil_valve = 0.5, fan_speed = 0.5.
- This seems to be providing adequate cooling (all temps stable, near 26) and enough ventilation to bring Z1 CO2 down slightly.
- We can refine by:
  - Slightly boosting ventilation effectiveness for Z1/Z3 (higher OA or more total flow) to get CO2 under target.
  - Avoid overcooling Z2–Z4; they are slightly warm but within band. Outdoor is hot, so we rely on coil rather than excessive OA for temperature control.

4) Strategy for each actuator:
- Zone dampers:
  - Z1 (CO2 1005, ideal temp): keep damper relatively high to provide flow and ventilation.
  - Z2 (26.3°C, 974 ppm rising slightly): moderate damper; no need to increase, to avoid extra cooling/power.
  - Z3 (26.5°C, 985 ppm trending slightly down): keep damper reasonably open for both cooling and CO2.
  - Z4 (26.7°C, 827 ppm): warm but low CO2. Current damper 0.64; slight increase for thermal comfort is acceptable, but big increase would add fan power. Given it’s within band and trend flat, only a small or no change is warranted.
  - To avoid fan energy growth from additional total flow, we’ll make only minimal positive adjustments, primarily in Z1/Z3, and keep Z2 similar, Z4 almost unchanged.

- OA damper:
  - Currently 0.4 (range 0.05–0.6). Z1 CO2 is just over target but trending down already.
  - A small OA increase improves CO2 uniformly, at some energy cost. Given penalty for CO2 and low effect on chiller vs. fan (short horizon), a modest increase is justified.
  - Move OA to ~0.45 (less than max 0.6) to gently accelerate CO2 reduction without a big energy penalty.

- Coil valve:
  - 0.5 with all zones within 25–27°C and basically flat temperature trends.
  - Outdoor 30.8°C; building has some thermal inertia. If we cut coil significantly, temps in warmer zones (3,4) may drift toward 27+°C.
  - Maintaining ~0.5 keeps stable comfort; no evidence of overcooling.
  - Keep coil at 0.5 for this interval.

- Fan speed:
  - At 0.5 (min is 0.45). To improve CO2 (especially with OA slightly higher), airside power will rise if we raise it.
  - However, CO2 is only marginally above target, and zone CO2 trends are already acceptable. We can let the slight OA increase work without increasing fan.
  - Keep fan at 0.5 (close to minimum), as fan power is usually significant in the energy term.

5) Concrete setpoints (with bounds check):
- Zone dampers (bounds 0.05–1.0):
  - Z1: slightly up from 0.9 to 0.92 for a bit more flow/ventilation.
  - Z2: keep at 0.75.
  - Z3: slightly up from 0.85 to 0.87.
  - Z4: keep at 0.64.
- OA damper (0.05–0.6): increase from 0.4 to 0.45.
- Coil valve (0.06–1.0): keep at 0.5.
- Fan speed (0.45–1.4): keep at 0.5.

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures remain in 25–27°C band, with slight cooling in Z3/Z4 due to marginally higher flow and unchanged coil.
- CO2 in Z1 should move clearly below 1000 ppm, Z2/Z3 stay near or below target, Z4 remains low.
- Energy: fan speed unchanged and only small damper/OA tweaks, coil unchanged → modest increase in ventilation effectiveness with a minimal power penalty, improving the CO2-related reward more than the energy penalty.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.92, 0.75, 0.87, 0.64], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.5}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort assessment:
- Target is 26°C (comfort band 25–27°C).
- Zone 1: 25.9°C (almost perfect, slightly cool vs. target, within band).
- Zone 2: 26.3°C (slightly warm but very close to target, well within band).
- Zone 3: 26.5°C (a bit warmer than target but still clearly within band).
- Zone 4: 26.7°C (warmest, but still inside 25–27°C band).
All zones are within the comfort band and nearly around the comfort center. No strong need to increase cooling; if anything, a very mild tendency to cool Zones 2–4, but temperatures are nearly flat (temp_delta ≈ 0) so we should avoid aggressive changes.

2) CO2 assessment:
- Zone 1: 996 ppm, trending down at -1.6 ppm/min → after 5 minutes ≈ 988 ppm.
- Zone 2: 970 ppm, -0.8 ppm/min → ≈ 966 ppm.
- Zone 3: 980 ppm, -1.0 ppm/min → ≈ 975 ppm.
- Zone 4: 823 ppm, -0.8 ppm/min → ≈ 819 ppm.
All zones are below the 1000 ppm target, trends are downward, and well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold. We can safely avoid increasing outdoor air; we can even slightly reduce OA damper to save energy without risking CO2 violations in the next 5 minutes.

3) Energy / plant status:
- Outdoor temperature: 30.8°C, higher than indoor (25.9–26.7°C). So more OA increases sensible cooling load. Since CO2 is fine, we should lean toward the minimum OA that still maintains good IAQ over time, but we only control the next 5 minutes and CO2 is trending downward.
- Previous actions:
  - Zone dampers: [0.92, 0.75, 0.87, 0.64]
  - OA damper: 0.45 (bound 0.05–0.6)
  - Coil valve: 0.50 (bound 0.06–1.0)
  - Fan speed: 0.50 (bound 0.45–1.4)
Energy use is driven by fan speed, coil valve (chilled water/compressor load), and OA fraction (indirectly increasing cooling load).

Given comfort is good and CO2 is slightly under target and falling, the optimal move is to gently reduce energy: lower fan and coil slightly and modestly trim OA, while keeping zone dampers near current levels to avoid sudden flow redistribution and comfort swings.

4) Zone-by-zone damper reasoning:
- Zone 1: Slightly cool (25.9°C). Can modestly reduce its damper to trim cooling and save some fan/zone energy.
- Zones 2 & 3: Slightly warm (26.3–26.5°C) but stable. Keep them close to current to avoid causing warm drift.
- Zone 4: Warmest at 26.7°C, still within band. We should not reduce its damper; we can keep it similar or slightly increase to maintain or gently cool.
We also prefer small changes for stability.

5) Chosen damper adjustments:
Previous: [0.92, 0.75, 0.87, 0.64]
- Zone 1: decrease slightly to 0.88 (less flow to a slightly cool zone).
- Zone 2: keep at 0.75 (near ideal, small error).
- Zone 3: keep at 0.87 (slight warmth but acceptable; we’re also lowering coil & fan a bit, so keep damper high for that zone).
- Zone 4: increase slightly to 0.68 to help the warmest zone while overall system capacity is slightly reduced.
These are small, non-aggressive shifts that preserve comfort while maintaining balance.

6) OA damper decision:
- At 0.45 with CO2 below 1000 ppm and trending down. Reducing OA saves chiller energy because 30.8°C outdoor air is warmer than zone air.
- However, we do not want to cut OA too sharply; we should stay in a mid–low range. A modest reduction to 0.40 balances IAQ robustness with savings.
- CO2 trends suggest that even with slightly less OA, we are unlikely to approach 1000 ppm, let alone 1100 ppm, within 5 minutes.

7) Coil valve decision:
- Comfort is within band, with mild warmth in Zones 2–4 but tiny errors and flat temp trends.
- Outdoor is hot, but we don’t need more cooling. Reducing cooling slightly will save energy; zone temps might drift very slightly but should remain within band over 5 minutes.
- Decrease coil valve from 0.50 to 0.45 for a modest energy saving while retaining adequate cooling to avoid fast warm-up.

8) Fan speed decision:
- At lower airflows, fan power drops significantly, but dropping too low could degrade comfort distribution and ventilation.
- Current fan speed: 0.50 with lower bound 0.45. We can move slightly toward the minimum to reduce power while still ensuring distribution: choose 0.48 rather than going all the way to 0.45, because we are only slightly relaxing cooling/coils and OA.
- Combined with modest damper changes, this should hold comfort within band.

9) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers: all chosen within [0.05, 1.0].
  - [0.88, 0.75, 0.87, 0.68] → valid.
- OA damper: 0.40 within [0.05, 0.6] → valid.
- Coil valve: 0.45 within [0.06, 1.0] → valid.
- Fan speed: 0.48 within [0.45, 1.4] → valid.

10) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures remain in 25–27°C band; Zones 2–4 may cool slightly or stay near current values due to maintained flow and slightly reduced but still significant coil power.
- CO2 remains below 1000 ppm and well below 1100 ppm given downward trends and only modest OA reduction.
- Fan and cooling energy are modestly reduced, improving the reward via lower power term without triggering comfort or CO2 penalties.

These settings thus aim to maximize reward by preserving comfort and IAQ while shaving energy.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.75, 0.87, 0.68], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.45, ""fan_speed"": 0.48}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1) Comfort assessment:\n- Target is 26°C (comfort band 25–27°C).\n- Zone 1: 25.9°C (almost perfect, slightly cool vs. target, within band).\n- Zone 2: 26.3°C (slightly warm but very close to target, well within band).\n- Zone 3: 26.5°C (a bit warmer than target but still clearly within band).\n- Zone 4: 26.7°C (warmest, but still inside 25–27°C band).\nAll zones are within the comfort band and nearly around the comfort center. No strong need to increase cooling; if anything, a very mild tendency to cool Zones 2–4, but temperatures are nearly flat (temp_delta ≈ 0) so we should avoid aggressive changes.\n\n2) CO2 assessment:\n- Zone 1: 996 ppm, trending down at -1.6 ppm/min → after 5 minutes ≈ 988 ppm.\n- Zone 2: 970 ppm, -0.8 ppm/min → ≈ 966 ppm.\n- Zone 3: 980 ppm, -1.0 ppm/min → ≈ 975 ppm.\n- Zone 4: 823 ppm, -0.8 ppm/min → ≈ 819 ppm.\nAll zones are below the 1000 ppm target, trends are downward, and well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold. We can safely avoid increasing outdoor air; we can even slightly reduce OA damper to save energy without risking CO2 violations in the next 5 minutes.\n\n3) Energy / plant status:\n- Outdoor temperature: 30.8°C, higher than indoor (25.9–26.7°C). So more OA increases sensible cooling load. Since CO2 is fine, we should lean toward the minimum OA that still maintains good IAQ over time, but we only control the next 5 minutes and CO2 is trending downward.\n- Previous actions:\n  - Zone dampers: [0.92, 0.75, 0.87, 0.64]\n  - OA damper: 0.45 (bound 0.05–0.6)\n  - Coil valve: 0.50 (bound 0.06–1.0)\n  - Fan speed: 0.50 (bound 0.45–1.4)\nEnergy use is driven by fan speed, coil valve (chilled water/compressor load), and OA fraction (indirectly increasing cooling load).\n\nGiven comfort is good and CO2 is slightly under target and falling, the optimal move is to gently reduce energy: lower fan and coil slightly and modestly trim OA, while keeping zone dampers near current levels to avoid sudden flow redistribution and comfort swings.\n\n4) Zone-by-zone damper reasoning:\n- Zone 1: Slightly cool (25.9°C). Can modestly reduce its damper to trim cooling and save some fan/zone energy.\n- Zones 2 & 3: Slightly warm (26.3–26.5°C) but stable. Keep them close to current to avoid causing warm drift.\n- Zone 4: Warmest at 26.7°C, still within band. We should not reduce its damper; we can keep it similar or slightly increase to maintain or gently cool.\nWe also prefer small changes for stability.\n\n5) Chosen damper adjustments:\nPrevious: [0.92, 0.75, 0.87, 0.64]\n- Zone 1: decrease slightly to 0.88 (less flow to a slightly cool zone).\n- Zone 2: keep at 0.75 (near ideal, small error).\n- Zone 3: keep at 0.87 (slight warmth but acceptable; we’re also lowering coil & fan a bit, so keep damper high for that zone).\n- Zone 4: increase slightly to 0.68 to help the warmest zone while overall system capacity is slightly reduced.\nThese are small, non-aggressive shifts that preserve comfort while maintaining balance.\n\n6) OA damper decision:\n- At 0.45 with CO2 below 1000 ppm and trending down. Reducing OA saves chiller energy because 30.8°C outdoor air is warmer than zone air.\n- However, we do not want to cut OA too sharply; we should stay in a mid–low range. A modest reduction to 0.40 balances IAQ robustness with savings.\n- CO2 trends suggest that even with slightly less OA, we are unlikely to approach 1000 ppm, let alone 1100 ppm, within 5 minutes.\n\n7) Coil valve decision:\n- Comfort is within band, with mild warmth in Zones 2–4 but tiny errors and flat temp trends.\n- Outdoor is hot, but we don’t need more cooling. Reducing cooling slightly will save energy; zone temps might drift very slightly but should remain within band over 5 minutes.\n- Decrease coil valve from 0.50 to 0.45 for a modest energy saving while retaining adequate cooling to avoid fast warm-up.\n\n8) Fan speed decision:\n- At lower airflows, fan power drops significantly, but dropping too low could degrade comfort distribution and ventilation.\n- Current fan speed: 0.50 with lower bound 0.45. We can move slightly toward the minimum to reduce power while still ensuring distribution: choose 0.48 rather than going all the way to 0.45, because we are only slightly relaxing cooling/coils and OA.\n- Combined with modest damper changes, this should hold comfort within band.\n\n9) Bounds check:\n- Zone dampers: all chosen within [0.05, 1.0].\n  - [0.88, 0.75, 0.87, 0.68] → valid.\n- OA damper: 0.40 within [0.05, 0.6] → valid.\n- Coil valve: 0.45 within [0.06, 1.0] → valid.\n- Fan speed: 0.48 within [0.45, 1.4] → valid.\n\n10) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:\n- Temperatures remain in 25–27°C band; Zones 2–4 may cool slightly or stay near current values due to maintained flow and slightly reduced but still significant coil power.\n- CO2 remains below 1000 ppm and well below 1100 ppm given downward trends and only modest OA reduction.\n- Fan and cooling energy are modestly reduced, improving the reward via lower power term without triggering comfort or CO2 penalties.\n\nThese settings thus aim to maximize reward by preserving comfort and IAQ while shaving energy."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Interpret objectives and current state:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO₂ target: < 1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm.
- Minimise energy via lower fan, coil, and damper openings.

Current zone conditions:
- Z1: 25.9°C (essentially on setpoint), temp stable; CO₂ 999 ppm, rising +0.4 ppm/min → ~+2 ppm over next 5 min → ~1001 ppm (slightly above target but far below 1100 violation).
- Z2: 26.3°C (+0.3°C above setpoint, well within band), temp stable; CO₂ 972 ppm, +0.5 ppm/min → ~+2.5 ppm → ~975 ppm (<1000).
- Z3: 26.5°C (+0.5°C above setpoint), temp stable; CO₂ 981 ppm, +0.3 ppm/min → ~+1.5 ppm → ~982.5 ppm (<1000).
- Z4: 26.7°C (+0.7°C above setpoint), still inside band but upper side; CO₂ 822 ppm, stable.

Outdoor: 30.7°C, hotter than indoors; slight cooling trend outside but still not suitable to heavily increase OA for free cooling.

Previous actuators:
- Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.75, 0.87, 0.68]
- OA damper: 0.40
- Coil valve: 0.45
- Fan speed: 0.48 (near minimum 0.45)

2) Trade-offs:
- Temperatures are acceptable; only Z4 is near upper edge but still within 27°C limit and trending flat.
- CO₂: Z1 is right at the 1000 ppm target and projected to slightly exceed it; other zones are below target.
- Energy: Fan already near minimum; coil at moderate 0.45; dampers fairly high → more airflow and reheat loads.

Given reward: comfort is good and small deviations are heavily penalised via a Gaussian-like penalty (sigma 0.25). CO₂ penalty weight is 0.5, but violation penalty of 10 only kicks at 1100 ppm. Being slightly above 1000 ppm in Z1 will incur small penalty, but increasing OA or fan substantially would raise power (weight 0.2) and may overcool some zones, increasing comfort penalty.

A sensible strategy for the next 5 minutes:
- Avoid aggressive change: system is steady and comfortable.
- Keep OA damper around current 0.40 (within allowed 0.05–0.6) to sustain ventilation for Z1 and not raise cooling load too much.
- Slightly bias cooling to gently nudge temperatures down, especially Z4, but avoid big coil/fan increases.
- Slightly reallocate airflow from over-served zones toward those a bit warmer (Z3/Z4), without major fan increase.

3) Zone damper strategy:
- Z1: Temp 25.9 (slightly below setpoint), CO₂ highest and near target. Reducing airflow too much might push CO₂ faster above 1000. However, damper at 0.88 is high. Slight reduction to cut energy while still ventilating.
  -> Move from 0.88 → 0.84.

- Z2: Slightly warm (26.3) but within band, CO₂ moderate and rising. Airflow 0.75. Can reduce slightly for energy, as comfort is not threatened and CO₂ will remain <1000.
  -> 0.75 → 0.72.

- Z3: 26.5, warmer and closer to upper end; CO₂ also high-ish but below 1000. It may benefit from equal or slightly more airflow. But since fan is near minimum, opening too much may not have huge effect and increases fan/system energy. Keep roughly similar or slightly higher to bias more cooling.
  -> 0.87 → 0.89 (small increase).

- Z4: 26.7, highest temp; CO₂ low. Increase airflow modestly for more cooling without touching coil too much.
  -> 0.68 → 0.72.

Overall, we re-balance: reduce Z1 & Z2 a bit, increase Z3 & Z4 slightly, net effect roughly neutral or slightly higher total, but energy impact is small because fan remains near minimum.

4) OA damper:
- Z1 is right at CO₂ target and increasing. Keeping OA at 0.40 should provide adequate fresh air without too much additional cooling load.
- Increasing OA toward 0.5–0.6 would help CO₂ but cost cooling energy and risk overcooling cooler zones; still no pressing CO₂ violation risk (we are ~1000–1010 forecast, far from 1100).
- Decreasing OA would save energy but likely push Z1 CO₂ well above 1000 and raise CO₂ penalty.

Thus, keep OA unchanged at 0.40.

5) Coil valve:
- We want a slight cooling bias to keep Z3/Z4 from drifting above 27°C, but temperatures are basically flat and the interval is only 5 minutes.
- Increasing coil above 0.45 will increase chiller/pump energy. Many zones are already within band, some slightly below setpoint (Z1).
- Decreasing coil may let Z3/Z4 edge upward, potentially closer to 27+ especially with warm outdoor air (30.7°C).

Best compromise: hold coil at 0.45 to maintain current conditions and avoid additional energy use.

6) Fan speed:
- Current fan 0.48, just above minimum 0.45. Lowering to minimum would save fan energy but also reduce ventilation rates and cooling delivery, not ideal with Z1 CO₂ at 999+ and Z3/Z4 warm.
- Increasing fan would help distribute cooling and dilute CO₂ but costs energy. Given only slight comfort/CO₂ pressures, that likely reduces reward.

Thus, maintain fan speed at 0.48.

7) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers: values chosen in [0.05, 1.0].
- OA damper: 0.40 in [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.45 in [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.48 in [0.45, 1.4]. All are inside bounds so no clipping required.

8) Summary of intent:
- Maintain nearly the same system state with minor rebalancing of zone dampers to move a bit more air to warmer zones, keep OA/coiling/fan roughly constant to preserve comfort and CO₂ while controlling energy. This is a conservative, high-reward action given all constraints and the short 5-minute horizon.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.84, 0.72, 0.89, 0.72], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.45, ""fan_speed"": 0.48}","{

- Zone 4: T = 26.7°C (0.7°C above setpoint, slightly warm but within band), trend = -0.01°C/min (slowly cooling), CO2 = 821 ppm, decreasing.

Outdoor: 30.4°C, trending cooler later, but currently significantly hotter than zones, so outdoor air is thermally “unfavorable” (adds cooling load) but needed for CO2 control.

Previous action:
- Zone dampers: [0.84, 0.72, 0.89, 0.72]
- OA damper: 0.40 (in middle of 0.05–0.60 range)
- Coil valve: 0.45
- Fan speed: 0.48 (near minimum 0.45)

2) CO2 considerations for next 5 minutes:
- Z1 CO2: 1001 ppm, +0.5 ppm/min → projected ~1003.5 ppm in 5 min without control change. Very close to target but below violation; still in penalty region above 1000 ppm.
- Z2 CO2: 976 ppm, +0.7 ppm/min → ~979.5 ppm.
- Z3 CO2: 982 ppm, +0.2 ppm/min → ~983 ppm.
- Z4 CO2: 821 ppm, trending down.

We are near the CO2 target, with Z1 already above 1000 ppm. To reduce CO2 penalty and avoid drift upward toward 1100 ppm, we should slightly increase outdoor air and/or total airflow. But energy cost discourages aggressive increase.

3) Temperature and cooling needs:
- All zones are within 25–27°C comfort band; only mild warmth in Zones 2–4.
- Cooling coil at 0.45 and fan at 0.48 are already moderately low; zone temps are stable.
- Outdoor air is warmer than zones, so increasing OA damper slightly will reduce cooling effectiveness and may warm supply air slightly, but zones currently tolerate small extra warmth.

Given comfort is acceptable and stable, we can prioritize CO2 control and energy. However, CO2 penalties and violation penalties are potentially large compared to modest additional energy from small fan/OA bump, so a slight increase in ventilation is justified.

4) Strategy for next interval:
- Maintain or very slightly reduce cooling coil to avoid overcooling and extra chiller power, but keep enough to offset any small warming from added outdoor air.
- Slightly increase outdoor air damper to improve CO2 without a large thermal penalty.
- Slightly increase fan speed from near-minimum to improve ventilation and mixing, which helps all zones’ CO2 while still keeping energy relatively low.
- Adjust zone dampers to prioritize air to zones with higher CO2 and/or slightly warmer temps (Zones 1–3), and slightly reduce for Zone 4, which is cooler-trending and has low CO2.

5) Concrete adjustments:
- OA damper: from 0.40 → 0.45 (moderate increase for better CO2, still well below max 0.60 to limit energy/thermal impact).
- Fan speed: from 0.48 → 0.52 (small increase above minimum; improves overall ventilation and CO2 while keeping fan energy modest).
- Coil valve: from 0.45 → 0.42 (slight reduction to save cooling energy and partly offset thermal impact of higher OA; zones are slightly warm but well inside band, so a mild reduction remains safe. Fan increase will also increase heat transfer, so a slight coil reduction should not cause overheating within 5 minutes.)

Zone dampers allocation:
- Goals:
  * Zone 1: highest CO2 (1001 ppm) and near setpoint; give slightly more air for CO2 relief.
  * Zone 2: warmish (26.4°C) and rising CO2; keep relatively open.
  * Zone 3: 26.5°C and near 1000 ppm; also relatively open.
  * Zone 4: warmest but cooling slightly and has low CO2; we can modestly reduce its damper to free some airflow for others while still within comfort band.
- Previous: [0.84, 0.72, 0.89, 0.72]
- New proposal:
  * Zone 1: 0.88 (up from 0.84 for more ventilation/CO2 dilution).
  * Zone 2: 0.74 (slight increase from 0.72).
  * Zone 3: 0.90 (slight increase from 0.89).
  * Zone 4: 0.68 (slight reduction from 0.72 to bias flow toward high-CO2 zones but still reasonably open).

All values are well within bounds:
- Zone dampers: between 0.05 and 1.0.
- OA damper: 0.45 within [0.05, 0.6].
- Coil valve: 0.42 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.52 within [0.45, 1.4].

6) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes:
- Slightly higher outdoor air fraction + fan speed → reduce or reverse CO2 upward trends, especially in Zones 1–3, decreasing CO2 penalty and lowering risk of crossing 1100 ppm later.
- Slightly lower coil plus warmer outdoor air may keep or nudge temps around mid-26s, still well inside comfort band, likely with acceptable comfort reward.
- Energy increases moderately from fan and OA, but partially offset by lower coil valve; the trade-off should improve overall reward due to significant reduction in CO2 penalty and maintained comfort.

Thus, this action set balances comfort, CO2 control, and energy for the next 5-minute interval.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.74, 0.9, 0.68], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.42, ""fan_speed"": 0.52}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort assessment:
- Comfort band is 25–27°C with center at 26°C.
- Zone 1: 25.9°C (very close to setpoint, slightly cool), essentially stable.
- Zone 2: 26.3°C (slightly warm but well within band), stable.
- Zone 3: 26.4°C (slightly warm), stable to very slightly cooling.
- Zone 4: 26.7°C (warmer end of band), very slightly cooling.
All zones are within 25–27°C and trending flat to marginally down, so only modest cooling is needed to keep future temps within band while reducing energy.

2) CO2 assessment:
- Zone 1: 992 ppm, decreasing at -1.8 ppm/min. In 5 minutes: ~983 ppm, below 1000 and far from 1100.
- Zone 2: 970 ppm, trending down; in 5 minutes ~964 ppm.
- Zone 3: 975 ppm, trending down; in 5 minutes ~968 ppm.
- Zone 4: 816 ppm, trending down.
CO2 is below target and decreasing in all zones. Risk of crossing 1000 or 1100 ppm in the next 5 minutes is negligible, so we can reduce outside air and fan somewhat to save energy without CO2 risk.

3) Outdoor and system context:
- Outdoor temp: 30.2°C, higher than indoor, but trending down over the hour. Outdoor air is warmer than desired supply conditions, so more OA means more cooling needed. Since CO2 is fine, energy-optimal strategy is to slightly reduce OA fraction, but respect IAQ by not going to minimum if not necessary.
- Previous actuators:
  • Zone dampers: [0.88, 0.74, 0.90, 0.68]
  • OA damper: 0.45 (on a 0.05–0.60 range)
  • Coil valve: 0.42 (0.06–1.00)
  • Fan speed: 0.52 (0.45–1.40)
We aim to gently reduce energy while preserving comfort and CO2 margins.

4) Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- Cooling demand: Slightly warm in Zones 2–4, nearly perfect in Zone 1, with temps not rising. We can slightly reduce coil and fan to save power, but must be careful that Zone 4 (26.7°C) does not drift above 27°C. Given very small warm drift (actually slight cooling), a modest reduction is safe.
- Ventilation: CO2 is close to but below 1000 in Zones 1–3 and decreasing. A small reduction in OA damper is appropriate to save chiller energy while keeping CO2 below target and far from 1100.
- Zone balancing: Zones 2 and 3 are a little warmer than Zone 1; Zone 4 is warmest but already has a lower damper (0.68) than Z1 and Z3. Since all are in band and trending slightly down, we can uniformly trim dampers a bit to reduce total flow and fan power, with slightly less reduction where zones are warmer.

5) Concrete adjustments (small, conservative moves to avoid oscillation):
- Fan speed: From 0.52 down to 0.50. This modest reduction decreases fan power but should still maintain enough airflow given that temperatures are stable and only slightly warm in some zones.
- Coil valve: From 0.42 down to 0.40. Slight reduction reduces chiller load while relying on existing cool thermal mass and slow dynamics; current temps and small negative deltas suggest this will not cause significant warming in just 5 minutes.
- OA damper: From 0.45 down to 0.40. CO2 is decreasing; this maintains acceptable ventilation while lowering the enthalpy load.
- Zone dampers:
  • Zone 1 (slightly cool, 25.9°C): Reduce more than others to avoid overcooling and save energy: 0.88 → 0.82.
  • Zone 2 (26.3°C): Slightly above setpoint but safe; small reduction: 0.74 → 0.70.
  • Zone 3 (26.4°C): Similar to Zone 2 but slightly warmer; slightly less reduction: 0.90 → 0.86.
  • Zone 4 (26.7°C, warmest): Maintain relatively higher flow than if it were neutral but still trim a bit due to downward trend and to keep total flow reasonable: 0.68 → 0.66.
All choices are within the given bounds and are modest changes aimed at maximizing reward by cutting energy while preserving comfort and CO2 constraints over the coming 5-minute interval.

6) Bounds check:
- Zone dampers bounds [0.05, 1.0]: all proposed (0.82, 0.70, 0.86, 0.66) are within bounds.
- OA damper bounds [0.05, 0.6]: 0.40 is within bounds.
- Coil valve bounds [0.06, 1.0]: 0.40 is within bounds.
- Fan speed bounds [0.45, 1.4]: 0.50 is within bounds.
Thus no clipping needed.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.82, 0.7, 0.86, 0.66], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.4, ""fan_speed"": 0.5}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1. Interpret objectives and state:
- Comfort target: 26°C, acceptable band 25–27°C.
- CO2 target: <1000 ppm, hard violation at 1100 ppm.
- Minimize HVAC power (fan + coil).

Current zone conditions:
- Zone 1: 25.9°C (essentially on setpoint), CO2 992 ppm, slightly rising (+0.1 ppm/min).
- Zone 2: 26.4°C (0.4°C above target but within band), CO2 972 ppm, rising faster (+0.4 ppm/min).
- Zone 3: 26.4°C, CO2 974 ppm, slightly decreasing.
- Zone 4: 26.6°C, warmest zone, CO2 816 ppm, flat.

Outdoor: 30.1°C, warmer than zones ⇒ additional outdoor air increases sensible load, but needed to manage CO2. Trend is slightly cooling but still significantly above indoor temperatures.

Previous actions:
- Zone dampers: [0.82, 0.70, 0.86, 0.66]
- OA damper: 0.40 (on 0.05–0.60 range)
- Coil valve: 0.40 (on 0.06–1.0 range)
- Fan speed: 0.50 (on 0.45–1.4 range)

2. Anticipate 5‑minute evolution:
- CO2 projections (approx):
  - Zone 1: 992 + 0.1*5 ≈ 992.5 ppm (near 1000 but under target; trend is modest).
  - Zone 2: 972 + 0.4*5 ≈ 992 ppm.
  - Zone 3: 974 - 0.1*5 ≈ 973 ppm.
  - Zone 4: 816 + 0*5 = 816 ppm.
  All likely remain <1000 ppm if ventilation similar to previous action. No imminent risk of crossing 1100 ppm.

- Temperature projections:
  - Trends are roughly flat (0 or slight cooling). With coil valve 0.4 and fan 0.5, zones are being held close to current temps.
  - Outdoor is significantly hotter; increasing OA or reducing cooling will warm zones.

Given reward structure, avoiding CO2 penalty is important but each zone is close to target without high growth rates, so aggressive increase in ventilation is not necessary. Cooling and fan-power can likely be trimmed slightly while staying inside comfort band and below 1000 ppm.

3. Strategy:
- Maintain comfort with slight cooling bias to counter warm outdoor air, especially for Zone 4 (26.6°C) and Zones 2/3 (26.4°C).
- Keep CO2 just under 1000 ppm by maintaining or very slightly adjusting OA and mixing via fan speed, avoiding increases that would notably raise cooling load.
- Reduce energy a bit:
  - Coil: can be reduced slightly because current temperature errors are small and trends are nearly flat; but given outdoor 30.1°C and warmest zone at 26.6°C, only a modest reduction is safe.
  - Fan: currently just above minimum (0.5 vs lower bound 0.45). Dropping too much reduces ventilation and zone flow, worsening both CO2 and comfort; small reduction is possible but must consider CO2 proximity to 1000 ppm.
  - OA damper: currently 0.40. With CO2 close to 1000 ppm, reducing OA could push some zones above 1000, incurring penalty. Better to keep OA roughly constant or very slightly adjust but err on safety side.
- Zone dampers: shift flow toward warmer or higher‑CO2 zones (Zones 2, 3, 4) and slightly reduce for Zone 1 (already near setpoint and highest CO2 but essentially stable). However, Zone 1’s CO2 is highest and slightly increasing; drastically reducing its damper could cause a local CO2 peak. So use only mild rebalancing.

4. Concrete adjustments:
- Fan speed: from 0.50 → 0.48 (small reduction toward lower bound 0.45) to save some fan energy while likely maintaining enough flow for temperature and CO2 control.
- Coil valve: from 0.40 → 0.38. Slightly less cooling; given outdoor 30.1°C and zones slightly warm, we should not reduce more; this keeps temperatures near 26–26.5°C.
- OA damper: keep at 0.40. With two zones projecting around 992 ppm and one at 992 already, reducing OA risks crossing 1000 ppm; increasing OA would increase load. Holding steady balances CO2 vs energy.
- Zone dampers:
  - Zone 1: slightly reduce from 0.82 → 0.78 to save some flow and prioritize other zones, but not too much to avoid CO2 buildup.
  - Zone 2: slightly increase from 0.70 → 0.74; it is warmish and CO2 increasing fastest.
  - Zone 3: slight increase from 0.86 → 0.88; warmish and moderate CO2.
  - Zone 4: slight increase from 0.66 → 0.70; warmest zone, though low CO2.
These are gentle tweaks, preserving near‑previous operation while subtly biasing airflow to warmer/more active zones and shaving some energy.

5. Check bounds:
- Zone dampers: all between 0.05 and 1.0.
- OA damper: 0.40 within [0.05, 0.60].
- Coil valve: 0.38 within [0.06, 1.0].
- Fan speed: 0.48 within [0.45, 1.4].

6. Expected outcome next 5 minutes:
- Temperatures: small change, likely still within 25–27°C, with Zone 4 perhaps drifting slightly but still acceptable.
- CO2: similar trajectories; likely all remain below 1000 ppm, avoiding CO2 penalties.
- Power: small reduction via lower fan speed and coil valve, improving reward while preserving comfort and IAQ.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.78, 0.74, 0.88, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.38, ""fan_speed"": 0.48}","{
