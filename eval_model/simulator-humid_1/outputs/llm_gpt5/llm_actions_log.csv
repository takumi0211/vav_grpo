You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort assessment: All zones are overheated (28.4–28.7°C), above the 25–27°C band. Current cooling rates are weak (~0.02–0.04°C/min drop), so without stronger action they will remain >27°C for multiple intervals. Priority: increase cooling capacity. 2) CO2/ventilation: All zones are 492–584 ppm with upward trends, but 5-minute projections remain well below 1000 ppm. Therefore keep outdoor air at its minimum to avoid extra load and humidity. 3) Power strategy: Because power scales cubically, favor water-side (coil valve) before fan speed. Previous coil_valve=0.95; increasing to 1.0 provides extra sensible/latent capacity at relatively lower pump power penalty than a large fan increase. Then apply only a modest fan increase to boost total Q without a large cubic fan power jump. 4) Airflow distribution: Open zone dampers toward hotter zones to reduce throttling losses, allowing more flow into zones with highest temperature while keeping changes smooth to avoid oscillation. 5) Smoothness and constraints: Keep OA at minimum bound (0.05). Bump coil 0.95→1.00 (small). Increase fan 0.62→0.72 (moderate, still well below nominal), and open dampers slightly (0.8–0.95 to ~0.97–1.0). All within bounds. 6) Expected outcome: With coil at max and a modest fan increase plus more open dampers, cooling rate should rise significantly, aiming to bring zones toward ≤27°C over the next 1–2 intervals. Once within band, plan to trim fan speed first to reduce fan power while keeping coil high enough to hold 26°C. OA remains minimized to reduce chiller/coil load and humidity ingress.

    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Outdoor air is hot (31°C) and humid; extra OA would add load.

Keep OA damper at 0.05 (minimum) to minimize load and energy; increased total flow still increases absolute OA cfm, helping CO2 control. 5) Constraints check: All commands within bounds; CO2 remains well below 1000 ppm; changes are smooth and aligned with minimizing energy while pursuing comfort.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.86}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

In 5 minutes at current rates, they would drop ~0.35–0.40°C, landing within 26.2–26.9°C. 2) CO2/ventilation: CO2 levels (710–830 ppm) are well below 1000 ppm and rising ~7.6–8.5 ppm/min.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z1=26.5, Z4=26.6 slightly warm but cooling (-0.03°C/min). Z2=25.9 slightly cool and also cooling. CO2 levels rising in all zones; Z1 at 963 ppm with +8.8 ppm/min would exceed 1000 ppm in ~5 min if we do nothing. OA currently at minimum (0.05). 2) CO2 control with minimal energy: To keep CO2 ≤1000 while minimizing energy, increase ventilation just enough. Prefer raising OA fraction slightly over a large fan increase because fan power ~ f^3. Estimate: raising OA from 0.05→0.07 (+40%) reduces CO2 rise rates by ~40% at same flow. With a small fan reduction (0.78→0.76), net ventilation still increases by ~36% (0.07/0.05 × 0.76/0.78 ≈ 1.364). Z1 CO2 rise becomes ~8.8/1.364 ≈ 6.45 ppm/min; over 5 min ≈ +32 → ~995 ppm (≤1000). Other zones stay well below 1000. 3) Temperature/energy trade-off: Cooling surrogate Q ≈ k_air·f + k_water·w; power scales cubically. Coil is already high (0.9). To save power and avoid overcooling Z2, reduce fan slightly (0.78→0.76) rather than increasing it; keep coil at 0.9 to maintain capacity, since we’re adding some OA load. Avoid increasing OA more than needed due to chiller/coil energy. 4) Zone airflow balancing: Keep Z1 and Z4 dampers high (they are the warmest). Slightly trim Z2 damper (0.6→0.55) to reduce its cooling and to bias more flow/ventilation toward higher-need zones without a total flow increase. Leave Z3 as is. 5) Smooth changes and bounds: All adjustments are small (ΔOA=+0.02, Δfan=-0.02, Δdamper Z2=-0.05), within bounds, minimizing oscillations. 6) Expected outcomes in next 5 min: Z1 ≈ 26.4–26.45°C, Z4 ≈ 26.5°C (within band, closer to 26 than drifting warm), Z2 ~25.8°C (kept from drifting too low), Z3 ~26.05–26.1°C.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Assess comfort and trends. All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1 and Z4 are 26.4°C and cooling (~-0.03°C/min), Z3 is 26.1°C cooling, Z2 is 25.8°C and cooling (~-0.02°C/min). Without changes, Z1/Z3/Z4 would drift toward or below 26°C; Z2 risks dipping further below 26°C. Step 2: Assess CO2 and risk. Z1 is already above the 1000 ppm target at 1003 ppm and rising +7.7 ppm/min, which would cross 1050 ppm in about (1050-1003)/7.7 ≈ 6.1 minutes if uncorrected. Z3 (919 ppm, +7.3 ppm/min) would reach 1000 ppm in ~11 minutes; Z2 and Z4 are lower but rising. Step 3: Ventilation strategy with energy trade-off. To quickly reverse Z1’s CO2 rise while minimizing energy: increase OA fraction modestly (from 0.07 to 0.11, ~+57% OA flow at the same fan speed) and redistribute zone airflow toward higher-CO2 zones (keep Z1 fully open, open Z3 more; slightly throttle Z2 and Z4). Keep fan speed unchanged to avoid cubic fan power penalty; adjust OA fraction instead. Step 4: Cooling-energy balance. Increasing OA raises coil load; simultaneously reduce coil valve (0.90→0.85) to curb overcooling and save pump power. Pump power scales ~w^3: 0.85^3/0.90^3 ≈ 0.614/0.729 ≈ 0.84 → ~16% pump-power reduction. Fan remains at 0.76 (0.76^3 ≈ 0.439 of nominal). Step 5: Expected outcomes (next 5–10 min). CO2: Z1’s slope should move from +7.7 ppm/min toward ≲0 or slightly negative due to +OA and higher Z1 flow; Z3’s slope should reduce substantially; all zones should remain ≤1000 ppm and well below 1050 ppm. Temperature: Reduced coil plus slightly lower flow to Z2/Z4 should arrest over-cooling; Z2 should drift up toward 26°C; Z1/Z3 should stay near ~26.1–26.3°C. Step 6: Smoothness and constraints. All changes are moderate and within bounds, avoiding oscillations while prioritizing CO2 safety, comfort near 26°C, and lower total power.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.5, 0.85, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.11, ""coil_valve"": 0.85, ""fan_speed"": 0.76}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.

2) Temperature control with minimal power: Use water-side (coil valve) modestly to handle added OA load (pump typically cheaper than fan). Avoid overcooling Zones 2 and 3 by slightly reducing their dampers to reallocate flow toward Zone 1; keep Zone 4 damper steady since it is slightly warm.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort check: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C; Z1=26.1 (-0.01°C/min), Z2=25.8 (+0.01), Z3=25.9 (-0.01), Z4=26.2 (-0.01).

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Assess current conditions vs. objectives. All zone temperatures are within 25–27°C and near 26°C with small drifts. Outdoor air is hot and humid (32.8°C, high AH), so extra OA increases coil/chiller load. CO2 is the critical constraint: Z1 is already above the 1000 ppm target at 1004 ppm and rising (+3.2 ppm/min). Z2 (946, +3.9), Z3 (957, +3.3), Z4 (866, +2.2) are also trending up. We must increase ventilation to drive Z1 back below 1000 and slow/reverse rises elsewhere, while minimizing power.
Step 2: Choose levers with power trade-offs. Fan power scales cubically with speed; pump (coil valve) is cheaper than fan for load. Increasing OA fraction raises IAQ but adds coil/chiller load; keep OA as low as possible while meeting CO2. Z1’s damper is already maxed (1.0), so to help Z1 we must increase OA fraction and/or total fan flow. Prefer increasing OA fraction modestly rather than increasing fan speed (to avoid fan cubic penalty) and redistribute zone dampers to help higher-CO2 zones.
Step 3: OA and airflow plan. Increase OA damper from 0.30 to 0.46 to raise fresh-air delivery by ~53% at the same fan speed (0.30→0.46 gives 0.216→0.331 OA-flow index with f=0.72), which should reverse Z1’s CO2 trend and reduce others. Keep fan speed at 0.72 to avoid cubic fan power increase and oscillations; we only step OA more aggressively because Z1 exceeds the 1000 ppm target and is trending up.
Step 4: Thermal balance. Higher OA raises mixed-air temperature and latent load. Bump coil_valve from 0.82 to 0.86 to maintain supply temperature near target and keep zones close to 26°C. This increases pump power modestly (0.82^3≈0.551 to 0.86^3≈0.636, ~+0.085 ref units), still preferable to increasing fan (which would rise cubically). Temperatures remain within band with slight safety margin as outdoor temperature is rising.
Step 5: Zone damper redistribution. Keep Z1 at 1.0. Increase Z2 damper from 0.28 to 0.36 to slow its temperature rise and improve its ventilation share. Slightly reduce Z3 from 0.55 to 0.50 and Z4 from 0.80 to 0.70 to compensate, keeping total flow roughly balanced without changing fan speed. Z3 (25.9) and Z4 (26.1, slightly cooling) can spare some airflow while staying in comfort.
Step 6: Constraint and smoothness check. All commands within bounds. Changes are smooth except OA (larger step justified by IAQ constraint violation). Expected outcomes next 5 min: Z1 CO2 drops below 1000 ppm; Z2–Z3 CO2 growth slows or stabilizes; all zone temperatures remain near 26°C and well within 25–27°C. Power minimized by avoiding fan increase, modest pump increase, and only as much OA as needed for CO2 control.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.36, 0.5, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.46, ""coil_valve"": 0.86, ""fan_speed"": 0.72}","{

Z2 (946, +3.9), Z3 (957, +3.3), Z4 (866, +2.2) are also trending up. We must increase ventilation to drive Z1 back below 1000 and slow/reverse rises elsewhere, while minimizing power.\nStep 2: Choose levers with power trade-offs. Fan power scales cubically with speed; pump (coil valve) is cheaper than fan for load. Increasing OA fraction raises IAQ but adds coil/chiller load; keep OA as low as possible while meeting CO2. Z1’s damper is already maxed (1.0), so to help Z1 we must increase OA fraction and/or total fan flow. Prefer increasing OA fraction modestly rather than increasing fan speed (to avoid fan cubic penalty) and redistribute zone dampers to help higher-CO2 zones.\nStep 3: OA and airflow plan. Increase OA damper from 0.30 to 0.46 to raise fresh-air delivery by ~53% at the same fan speed (0.30→0.46 gives 0.216→0.331 OA-flow index with f=0.72), which should reverse Z1’s CO2 trend and reduce others. Keep fan speed at 0.72 to avoid cubic fan power increase and oscillations; we only step OA more aggressively because Z1 exceeds the 1000 ppm target and is trending up.\nStep 4: Thermal balance. Higher OA raises mixed-air temperature and latent load. Bump coil_valve from 0.82 to 0.86 to maintain supply temperature near target and keep zones close to 26°C. This increases pump power modestly (0.82^3≈0.551 to 0.86^3≈0.636, ~+0.085 ref units), still preferable to increasing fan (which would rise cubically). Temperatures remain within band with slight safety margin as outdoor temperature is rising.\nStep 5: Zone damper redistribution. Keep Z1 at 1.0. Increase Z2 damper from 0.28 to 0.36 to slow its temperature rise and improve its ventilation share. Slightly reduce Z3 from 0.55 to 0.50 and Z4 from 0.80 to 0.70 to compensate, keeping total flow roughly balanced without changing fan speed. Z3 (25.9) and Z4 (26.1, slightly cooling) can spare some airflow while staying in comfort.\nStep 6: Constraint and smoothness check. All commands within bounds. Changes are smooth except OA (larger step justified by IAQ constraint violation). Expected outcomes next 5 min: Z1 CO2 drops below 1000 ppm; Z2–Z3 CO2 growth slows or stabilizes; all zone temperatures remain near 26°C and well within 25–27°C. Power minimized by avoiding fan increase, modest pump increase, and only as much OA as needed for CO2 control."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess state: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C.

With lower OA load, trim coil_valve slightly (to 0.80) to reduce pump/compressor power while keeping comfort.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state:
- Temps: Z1 25.9 (slightly cool), Z2 26.0, Z3 26.0, Z4 26.2 (slightly warm). All within 25–27°C.
- CO2: Z1 997 ppm (highest, trending down −2.3 ppm/min), Z2 945, Z3 964, Z4 860. All ≤1000 and decreasing. Z1 is the constraint.
- Previous actuators: dampers [1.00, 0.42, 0.60, 0.60], OA 0.45, coil 0.85, fan 0.72.
- Outdoor 33.5°C and humid; OA adds cooling load.

2) Objectives and trade-offs:
- Prefer near 26°C while minimizing power. Fan and pump power scale ~cube; pump-side (coil) is typically cheaper than fan for the same added Q. Keep OA at minimum needed for CO2.

3) Strategy for this interval:
- CO2 safety: Because Z1 is at 997 ppm (borderline) but decreasing, avoid reducing OA this interval to ensure we don’t breach 1000–1050 ppm, especially as we plan a small fan reduction. Revisit OA reduction next interval if Z1 drops well below 990 ppm.
- Power reduction: Trim fan modestly to cut fan power (cube law) and avoid large changes. Keep coil at 0.85 (already high) to maintain capacity while fan is reduced; this favors energy savings without risking comfort.
- Rebalance airflow with zone dampers: Slightly reduce Z1 damper (it’s a bit cool and has the tightest CO2), and increase Z4 damper (a bit warm). Keep Z2/Z3 unchanged (on target, CO2 fine) to avoid unnecessary airflow.

4) Expected effects:
- Fan from 0.72→0.68: fan power ~0.72^3=0.373 to 0.68^3=0.314 (~16% fan power reduction). Coil unchanged (pump power unchanged). Total electrical likely down.
- CO2: A ~5–6% airflow reduction would modestly lessen ventilation. With OA held and Z1 damper only slightly reduced, Z1 CO2 should still trend down by roughly ~2 ppm/min, keeping it safely ≤1000 ppm.
- Temps: Z1 may drift up toward 26 (good). Z4 receives a bit more local flow, offsetting the slight fan reduction and nudging it toward 26. Z2/Z3 should stay near 26.

5) Smoothness and bounds: All changes are small to avoid oscillations and remain within actuator limits.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.92, 0.42, 0.6, 0.66], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.85, ""fan_speed"": 0.68}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone temps: Z1 25.9 (stable), Z2 26.1 (+0.01°C/min), Z3 26.0 (+0.01°C/min), Z4 26.3 (+0.01°C/min). CO2: Z1 996 ppm (−0.3 ppm/min), Z2 942 (−0.6), Z3 961 (−0.6), Z4 855 (−1.1). Outdoor air is hot (33.2°C) and humid; reducing OA will lower coil/chiller load. 2) Ventilation/CO2: With all zones <1000 ppm and trending down, OA can be reduced but not to minimum to protect Z1 (996 ppm). A moderated reduction from 0.45 to 0.25 should keep CO2 ≤1000 over the next 5 minutes while cutting load; this is a smooth change and maintains safety margin well below 1050 ppm. 3) Power strategy: To minimize total power, reduce coil water flow (pump/chiller) and modestly reduce fan speed (cubic scaling).

  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state and risks: All zone temperatures are within 25–27°C but drifting slightly upward (0.01–0.02°C/min). Zone 4 is the warmest at 26.4°C and could approach 27°C within the next 5–10 minutes if cooling is not slightly increased. CO2 is the main constraint: Zone 1 is at 1042 ppm and rising (~+1.3 ppm/min), which would approach 1050 ppm within minutes if uncorrected; Zone 3 is at 995 ppm and rising (~+1.9 ppm/min), likely to exceed 1000 ppm soon though still below the 1050 ppm hard limit. Outdoor air is very hot and humid (34.6°C, high AH), so we want to minimize OA intake to avoid unnecessary chiller/coil load. 2) Control objectives and priorities: (a) Prevent any zone from exceeding 1050 ppm CO2, and push Zones 1 and 3 toward ≤1000 ppm. (b) Keep all zones near 26°C without exceeding 27°C. (c) Minimize power: avoid fan speed increases (cubic penalty) when water-side (coil) adjustments can handle the load, and keep OA as low as possible consistent with CO2 control. 3) Strategy selection: To most efficiently address high CO2 in Zones 1 and 3 without a large energy penalty, (i) slightly increase OA fraction to raise actual ventilation air with minimal total flow change; (ii) reallocate supply via zone dampers to favor Zones 1 and 3 (higher CO2) while trimming Zone 2 (low CO2) and keeping Zone 4 steady (it’s the warmest). This targets ventilation to the critical zones rather than increasing overall fan speed (which would raise both OA and recirculated air and fan power cubically). 4) Temperature control: Slightly increase coil valve to counteract the small upward temp drift and the modest extra load from the small OA increase, prioritizing water-side over fan-side adjustments per energy guidance. Keep fan speed unchanged to avoid cubic power rise and potential oscillations. 5) Proposed adjustments (smooth changes from previous): - Zone dampers: Z1 to 1.00 (+0.02) to maximize ventilation/cooling where CO2 is highest; Z3 to 0.62 (+0.08) to address its rising CO2; Z2 to 0.34 (-0.06) since it’s below 1000 ppm and near setpoint; Z4 hold at 0.74 to avoid aggravating its higher temperature. - OA damper: small bump from 0.36 to 0.38 to ensure Zones 1 and 3 CO2 trajectories flatten and begin to decline, staying safely below the 1050 ppm limit. - Coil valve: from 0.75 to 0.76 to offset added OA load and temperature drift, favoring pump/water-side over fan due to better efficiency. - Fan speed: hold at 0.66 to avoid cubic increase in fan power. 6) Power rationale: Fan power remains ~0.66^3 ≈ 0.287 P_fan_ref. Pump power increases slightly from 0.75^3 ≈ 0.422 to 0.76^3 ≈ 0.438 P_pump_ref, a modest change that is typically cheaper than increasing fan. OA fraction increase is minimal (0.36→0.38), limiting extra chiller/coil load while ensuring CO2 compliance. 7) Expected outcomes in next 5 minutes: Z1 CO2 should stop rising and begin decreasing, remaining <1050 ppm with margin; Z3 should stay near or below 1000 ppm and start trending down. Temperatures should hold near current values, with Zone 4 staying below 27°C and ideally nudging closer to 26–26.6°C range.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z2 and Z4 are slightly warm (26.4–26.5°C) and trending up slowly; Z1 and Z3 are near target. 2) Assess CO2: Z1 = 1035 ppm (decreasing at -1.8 ppm/min), Z2 = 984 ppm (+1.1 ppm/min), Z3 = 989 ppm (-1.7 ppm/min), Z4 = 881 ppm. Priority is to bring Z1 below 1000 ppm quickly without overshooting energy; keep Z2 from crossing 1000 ppm. 3) Strategy per objectives: Minimise OA but increase it enough to accelerate Z1 CO2 drop; reallocate airflow toward Z1 and Z2 via dampers; prefer increasing coil_valve (water flow) over fan speed for thermal load because pump power is generally cheaper than fan; only modestly increase fan to boost ventilation. 4) Actuator adjustments: - OA damper: moderate increase to provide more fresh air systemwide while avoiding excessive chiller load. - Zone dampers: keep Z1 at 1.0 (max), open Z2 slightly to arrest its rising CO2 and slight warmth, trim Z3 a bit (it’s stable and CO2 is dropping) to bias flow to Z1/Z2, keep Z4 unchanged (already warm). - Coil valve: small increase to handle added OA heat and nudge all zones slightly cooler toward 26°C, favoring pump over fan energy. - Fan speed: modest increase to raise total ventilation without a large cubic power penalty. 5) Smoothness/limits: All changes are moderate relative to previous settings and within bounds. 6) Expected outcomes in next 5 min: Z1 CO2 drop rate increases (from -1.8 ppm/min to a more negative value) due to higher OA, slightly higher total flow, and reallocation, aiming to bring it closer to/below 1000 ppm while staying well under 1050 ppm.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:

- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1=26.0 (slightly falling), Z2=26.5 (flat), Z3=26.3 (+0.01/min), Z4=26.4 (flat). Aim to nudge Z2 and Z3 slightly cooler toward 26 without increasing fan power.
Step 2: CO2 assessment. Z3 is the tightest at 988 ppm and rising +2.2 ppm/min under current OA=0.4 and fan=0.7; 5‑min projection ≈999 ppm if nothing changes. Reducing OA would risk exceeding 1000. Strategy: hold OA fraction and shift more supply to Z3 to increase delivered OA to that zone without increasing fan speed.
Step 3: Power strategy. Fan power is cubic; avoid increasing fan. Prefer rebalancing zone dampers and using coil valve. Since zones are only slightly warm, modest redistribution plus a slight reduction in coil valve should save pump/chiller energy while holding comfort.
Step 4: Control moves (smooth, within bounds). 
- Keep fan_speed at 0.70 (avoid cubic fan penalty; preserves ventilation).
- Keep oa_damper at 0.40 (hot/humid outside; Z3 CO2 near limit; do not reduce).
- Rebalance zone dampers: decrease Z1 and Z4 slightly, increase Z2 and Z3 to shift cooling/ventilation to warmer/high-CO2 zones.
- Reduce coil_valve slightly from 0.90 to 0.88 to cut pump/chiller use; increased airflow to Z2/Z3 offsets the small reduction in coil capacity.
Step 5: Safety checks. CO2: With Z3 damper increased ~+17% (0.60→0.70) at same OA fraction, its CO2 rise rate should ease (~2.2/1.17 ≈1.9 ppm/min), 5‑min projection ≈997 ppm (<1000). Temperatures remain within 25–27°C with slight cooling bias to Z2/Z3. All changes are modest to avoid oscillations.
Step 6: Power impact. Fan stays at 0.7 → ~0.343 P_fan_ref. Pump: 0.88^3 ≈0.681 P_pump_ref vs 0.9^3 ≈0.729 prior (≈6–7% pump savings). OA unchanged to avoid extra latent load.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.6, 0.7, 0.68], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.88, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone 3 CO2 is 994 ppm and rising, close to the 1000 ppm target. Outdoor air is hot/humid, so reducing OA lowers cooling/latent load.

Decisions: - Slightly reduce OA damper to cut load but increase Zone 3 damper to maintain/increase its effective outdoor air delivery; modestly open Zone 2 to cool it. - Trim Zone 1 and Zone 4 dampers slightly to rebalance without overcooling. - Nudge coil valve up for more sensible capacity; keep fan speed steady to maintain ventilation without cubic fan power penalty.

    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1=25.9 (slightly cool), Z2=26.4, Z3=26.4, Z4=26.5 (slightly warm). Temperature trends are ~flat, so current cooling is roughly matching load. 2) Assess CO2/ventilation: Z1=994 ppm, Z3=991 ppm are close to 1000 ppm but trending slightly downward (~-0.1 ppm/min). This suggests OA is a bit higher than needed; however, the headroom is small, so only a minor OA reduction is safe. 3) Outdoor air conditions: 33.6°C and humid, increasing. Reducing OA modestly will cut coil/chiller load (latent + sensible) without compromising CO2, if done cautiously. 4) Energy trade-offs: Fan and pump power scale cubically. Prefer water-side (coil_valve) adjustments over fan for load changes. Since comfort is met and CO2 is near limit, avoid increasing fan. 5) Strategy: Keep fan_speed steady to avoid cutting ventilation flow; slightly reduce OA damper (small step) to trim load; rebalance zone dampers to shift more cooling to warmer zones (Z2–Z4) and slightly throttle Z1; keep coil_valve steady to maintain SAT and avoid temperature drift upward. 6) Smoothness: Make small adjustments from previous commands to avoid oscillations. 7) Safety check: With OA from 0.40 to 0.38 (~5% drop) and steady fan, ventilation reduction is modest; given CO2 trends are negative, Z1 and Z3 should remain ≤1000 ppm (well below the 1050 ppm hard limit).

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

With current negative CO2 trends, the reduced OA should still keep Z1 and Z3 at or below 1000 over the next 5 minutes, especially as we bias more supply to them. 6) Fan/coil: Keep coil_valve at 1.0 to provide colder supply air as OA drops; slightly reduce fan_speed from 0.72 to 0.70 to save cubic fan power without risking comfort. 7) Zone airflow distribution: Increase dampers to warmer/high-CO2 zones to maintain comfort and ventilation where needed: Z3 to 1.0 (max), Z4 up a bit, Z1 up slightly; hold Z2. 8) Expected outcome (next 5 min): Colder mixed air + high coil offsets the small fan reduction; zone temps nudge toward 26°C. CO2 remains ≤1000 with Z1/Z3 near-flat to slightly decreasing. 9) Smoothness/limits: Changes are modest; all actuators within bounds; no clipping required."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Priority: increase cooling to Zone 4; keep others near 26C without overshoot.
2) CO2 status: Z1=1012 ppm (>1000 target, <1050 hard limit) trending down -2.3 ppm/min; Z2=996 ppm trending down; Z3=991 ppm trending down; Z4=873 ppm trending down. We must ensure Z1 drops to ≤1000 promptly and avoid pushing Z2 above 1000.
3) Energy/actuator strategy: Water-side is already maxed (coil_valve=1.0), so use small fan increase next (cubic cost) and redistribute with zone dampers. Keep OA fraction at minimum necessary; outdoor air is hot and humid, so avoid increasing OA. Because Z1 CO2 is just above target, do not reduce OA right now; a small fan increase boosts absolute OA and dilution while also aiding Zone 4 cooling.
4) Specific adjustments:
   - Coil valve: hold at 1.0 (max capacity already engaged; cheaper than adding more fan for the same load; we need more cooling for Z4).
   - Fan speed: small increase 0.87 → 0.89 to provide modest extra cooling capacity and slightly more ventilation/dilution system-wide without big cubic penalty.
   - OA damper: hold at 0.37 to avoid reducing absolute OA while Z1 is above 1000 ppm; once Z1 is <1000 with margin, we can trim OA next interval.
   - Zone dampers: keep Z1 at 1.0 to maximize dilution and avoid raising its CO2; keep Z2 at 0.95 (near 1000 ppm—don’t reduce its ventilation); slightly reduce Z3 from 0.85→0.82 (CO2 well below 1000, temperature near target) to free airflow; increase Z4 from 0.50→0.62 to deliver more cooling where it’s needed.
5) Expected outcomes next 5 minutes: Z1 CO2 should cross to ≤1000 (trend strengthened by ~+2–3% flow), temperature stays within band. Z2 CO2 remains ≤1000 with unchanged damper and slight fan boost; temperature drifts toward 26C. Z3 remains within temp band and ≤1000 ppm despite a small damper trim. Z4 begins cooling from 26.5C with increased airflow plus slight fan increase. OA is not increased, limiting latent/sensible load rise.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1 is slightly cool (25.8, drifting down), Z2/Z3 slightly warm (26.3/26.2, flat to slightly cooling), Z4 warmest (26.4, slightly cooling). Aim to move all toward 26°C without overshoot. 2) CO2 status: All zones below 1000 ppm; Z1 is closest at 992 ppm but trending down. Outdoor air is very hot/humid, so we should reduce OA to cut load, but keep CO2 ≤ 1000. 3) Energy strategy: Avoid large fan changes due to cubic power. Prefer using coil (water) over fan for load adjustments; also minimize OA to reduce coil/chiller load. 4) Actions chosen: - Reduce OA damper moderately from 0.37 to 0.28 to cut outside air load while keeping CO2 safety margin, especially for Z1 near 1000 ppm. - Keep fan speed at 0.89 this interval to avoid reducing total ventilation too much while OA is being lowered. - Keep coil valve at 0.93 to maintain cooling capacity as OA is reduced; this helps nudge warm zones toward 26°C without increasing fan. - Rebalance zone dampers to shift cooling toward warmer zones while easing overcooling in Z1: slightly throttle Z1 (to slow its cooling) and open Z2/Z4 a bit to improve their cooling. Z3 remains unchanged as it is near target and trending down. 5) Smoothness: All changes are modest to avoid oscillations.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1 is slightly cool (25.7, near 26), Z2–Z4 are slightly warm (26.1–26.2). Aim to nudge them toward 26 without overshoot. 2) CO2 and ventilation: Z1 CO2 is 998 ppm and trending down; others are <1000 and decreasing. Because Z1 is close to the 1000 ppm limit, reduce outdoor air only slightly and keep Z1 airflow high to maintain dilution. 3) Outdoor air cost: OA is hot/humid (35.1°C, high absolute humidity), so minimizing OA reduces coil/chiller load and dehumidification burden. 4) Power strategy: Fan and pump power scale cubically; prefer water-side (coil) over fan for added capacity, but coil is already high (0.96). Avoid fan increases; redistribute airflow with zone dampers to direct more cooling to warmer zones and not starve Z1 of ventilation. 5) Smooth changes: Make small adjustments to avoid oscillations and protect the CO2 limit. 6) Actions chosen: a) Keep coil_valve at 0.96 (maintain SAT/capacity). b) Hold fan_speed at 0.89 to preserve ventilation while avoiding cubic fan power increase. c) Trim oa_damper slightly from 0.36 to 0.35 to reduce OA load but keep CO2 compliant, especially in Z1. d) Adjust zone dampers to shift cooling where needed: keep Z1 at 1.0 to protect CO2 and avoid further OA reduction locally; increase Z2 to 1.0, Z3 to 0.85, Z4 to 0.70 to bring slightly warm zones closer to 26°C.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Concise rationale: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. Zone 1 CO2 is slightly above the 1000 ppm target and trending upward, so we need a modest increase in ventilation to that zone while minimizing energy and avoiding large OA increases. Actions: (1) Keep Zone 1 damper at max and slightly trim other zone dampers to shift more supply air toward Zone 1; (2) Small increase in fan speed to raise total ventilation; (3) Very small increase in OA fraction to ensure Zone 1 CO2 trends downward, kept minimal to limit latent/sensible load; (4) Slight reduction in coil valve to save pump/chiller power and prevent overcooling, relying on airflow adjustments to maintain comfort.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Check comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C with minimal temperature drift. Outdoor is very hot/humid (35°C, high AH), so extra OA would add significant cooling/latent load. 2) Check CO2: Zone 1 is 1001 ppm (slightly above 1000 target but below 1050 limit) and trending down at about −0.5 ppm/min. At current OA and airflow, it should reach ~998.5 ppm in 5 minutes. Other zones (974, 983, 851 ppm) are safely below 1000 ppm and trending down. 3) OA strategy: To minimize energy and latent load, OA should be kept as low as allowed, but given Zone 1 is just above 1000 ppm, reducing OA now risks reversing its downward trend. Keep OA damper steady this interval to ensure Zone 1 CO2 drops below 1000. 4) Airflow allocation: Zone 1 damper already at 1.0; to speed CO2 reduction without increasing OA or fan, slightly trim dampers in Zones 2–4 to bias more flow/ventilation to Zone 1. These zones have ample CO2 margin and stable temperatures, so small reductions are low risk. 5) Fan/coil trade-off: Pump (water) power is typically cheaper than fan power, but lowering fan now would reduce total ventilation and could jeopardize Zone 1 CO2. Coil is already high (0.94). To avoid oscillations and protect CO2 and comfort, hold fan and coil steady this interval. After Zone 1 CO2 is safely <1000, we can shift toward more coil and slightly lower fan and OA to cut power. 6) Smooth changes: Only small damper nudges to avoid oscillations. 7) Expected outcomes in 5 min: Zone 1 CO2 drops below 1000 (helped by reallocation), temperatures remain within band; OA minimized for now without risking CO2.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.88, 0.78, 0.53], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.94, ""fan_speed"": 0.9}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

CO2 is below 1000 ppm in all zones; Z1 is the tightest at 998 ppm but trending down. Outdoor air is very hot and humid (35.1°C, high absolute humidity), so outdoor air adds significant cooling/latent load. 2) Priorities: Maintain CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (hard never >1050). Minimise outdoor air to reduce chiller/coil load. Minimise electrical power, favouring water-side (coil valve) adjustments over fan speed for capacity due to cubic scaling and typically better pump efficiency. Avoid big, rapid moves. 3) Ventilation strategy: Since CO2 is below 1000 ppm and trending down, reduce OA damper moderately (0.35→0.30) to cut load while keeping a safety margin for Z1. Avoid larger OA cuts now because Z1 is near 1000 ppm; we also avoid reducing fan speed this interval to maintain ventilation effectiveness after the OA reduction. 4) Cooling capacity/power: Reduce coil valve slightly (0.94→0.88) to save pump/chiller energy; the OA reduction also lowers load, so this should keep temps in band. Keep fan at 0.90 this step to preserve ventilation given the OA cut; we can revisit fan reduction next interval if CO2 margin remains healthy. 5) Air distribution (zone dampers): Keep Z1 damper at 1.0 to protect its CO2 and reduce its slight overcooling via warmer supply (from reduced coil). Nudge more airflow to the slightly warm zones: Z2 0.88→0.92 and Z3 0.78→0.82.

Z2/Z3 should hold near 26°C with increased airflow despite a slightly warmer coil. Power drops via lower OA (reduced chiller) and lower coil valve (pump), without compromising ventilation safety.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Assess zone states vs. objectives. All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. Z1 is slightly cool (25.6°C) and has the highest CO2 (996 ppm) but trending down; Z2–Z4 are ~26.0–26.1°C with CO2 well below 1000 ppm and also trending down. Outdoor air is very hot and humid (35.1°C), so reducing outdoor air will cut coil/chiller load. Step 2: CO2/ventilation strategy. Keep OA near the minimum needed to satisfy CO2. Because Z1 CO2 is 996 ppm and currently decreasing (-2 ppm/min) at OA=0.38, we reduce OA cautiously to avoid reversal above 1000 ppm and maintain smoothness. Choose OA=0.34 (small 0.04 reduction) to still keep Z1 trending downward or near flat. Step 3: Power and capacity trade-offs. Since spaces are at setpoint or slightly cool and OA load is being reduced, we can back off cooling and airflow to save power. Pump (coil) power is typically cheaper than fan for the same load, but here the overall load can be reduced; so reduce coil_valve modestly (0.91→0.86) to avoid overcooling and cut pump power; trim fan slightly (0.90→0.88) to save cubic fan power without jeopardizing CO2 (paired with only a modest OA reduction). Step 4: Zone airflow distribution. Keep Z1 damper high (1.0) to favor ventilation for the borderline CO2 zone while letting its temperature drift toward 26°C via warmer supply from the reduced coil. Reduce Z2 and Z3 dampers a bit (0.85→0.78 and 0.90→0.82) since they are on/just above target and to reallocate flow. Slightly increase Z4 (0.45→0.50) to prevent further warming as we trim overall cooling. Step 5: Expected effects next 5 min. Z1 CO2: with OA and fan both slightly reduced (~12–13% less ventilation vs. previous), Z1’s -2 ppm/min trend should relax toward roughly -0.5 ppm/min, keeping it below 1000 ppm (≈992–995 ppm after 5 min). Zone temperatures should stay within band: Z1 should drift toward 26.0; Z2–Z3 may inch up slightly but remain ≈26.1–26.3; Z4 should hold near ~26.1–26.2 with the damper bump. Step 6: Bounds/smoothness. All actuators within limits and changes are small to avoid oscillations. This balances comfort and CO2 while minimizing OA, fan, and pump power.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.78, 0.82, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.34, ""coil_valve"": 0.86, ""fan_speed"": 0.88}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z2–Z4 are below 1000 ppm.

Temperatures should remain within 25–27°C, with Z2–Z4 staying near 26°C and Z1 not dropping below 25°C. 7) Smoothness and bounds: All changes are small relative to previous settings and within actuator limits."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z1 is slightly cool (25.6), Z2/Z3 ~26.1, Z4 26.2. CO2: Z1 = 1002 ppm (slightly above 1000) and trending up +0.1 ppm/min; Z2=977 (+0.4/min), Z3=984 (+0.3/min), Z4=858 (+0.2/min). OA damper is 0.35, fan 0.85, coil 0.86. Outdoor air is hot/humid, so extra OA increases cooling load. 2) Prioritise constraints: We must bring Z1 CO2 to ≤1000 without overshooting power. Z1 damper is already maxed (1.0), so we cannot allocate more air to Z1 by opening it further.

Outdoor air is hot/humid, so extra OA increases cooling load. 2) Prioritise constraints: We must bring Z1 CO2 to ≤1000 without overshooting power.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of control logic: All zones are within 25–27°C and near the 26°C target. Zone 1 is slightly cool and drifting cooler; Zones 2–4 are slightly warm to neutral.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

- Comfort status: Z1 is a bit cool (25.4°C, drifting down). Z2 is on setpoint and drifting slightly down. Z3 and Z4 are 26.1°C and stable. Overall, system is slightly overcooling.
- CO2/ventilation: Highest is Z3 at 989 ppm with a modest rise (~0.6 ppm/min). We can reduce OA to save energy while keeping a safe buffer to 1000 ppm. To avoid oscillations, make a moderate reduction rather than to minimum.
- Energy trade-offs: Fan and pump power scale ~cube of command. Prefer satisfying sensible load with water (coil) rather than fan. Since zones are slightly overcooled and outdoor air is hot, we can reduce OA, then trim coil and fan modestly to cut power while keeping comfort.
- Actuator strategy:
  1) Reduce OA damper from 0.28 → 0.18 to lower ventilation load and chiller energy while keeping CO2 below 1000 ppm. With fan slightly reduced too, OA flow drops to ~62% of prior; expected CO2 slopes roughly increase to ~0.9–1.0 ppm/min. Over 5 min: Z3 ≈ 989 + ~5 ≈ 994 ppm (still <1000). Others remain well below 1000. Large safety margin to 1050 ppm.
  2) Reduce coil valve 0.80 → 0.74 to ease pump power and let slightly warm zones drift toward 26°C without overshoot. Reduce fan 0.83 → 0.80 for cubic fan power savings; load is eased by less OA.
  3) Rebalance zone dampers to nudge temperatures toward 26°C: decrease Z1 and Z2 to reduce overcooling, slightly increase Z3 and Z4 to maintain comfort if total cooling drops. Changes are small to avoid oscillations.
- Constraints check: All commands within bounds; smooth adjustments.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1 is slightly cool (25.4°C), Z2≈25.9°C, Z3≈26.0°C, Z4≈26.1°C; temperature trends are flat to slightly cooling. We should avoid extra cooling in Z1 and not over-warm others. 2) Assess CO2: Z1=1006 ppm and Z3=1009 ppm are above the 1000 ppm target and rising; Z2=978 ppm and Z4=873 ppm are below but rising. We must increase effective outdoor air to reverse the trend, with priority to Zones 1 and 3. 3) Power strategy: Per cubic law, avoid increasing fan speed if possible. Increase OA fraction modestly (systemwide) and bias zone airflow distribution toward high-CO2 zones. Keep fan constant to save fan power. Coil/chiller load will rise with OA, but temperatures currently trend slightly down, so we can likely hold coil steady while the warmer mixed air counters overcooling in Z1. 4) Actuator moves and smoothness: Make moderate OA increase (0.18→0.28) to significantly boost ventilation without a fan change. Adjust zone dampers to route more air to Z3 and hold Z1 steady to limit further cooling; slightly reduce Z2 and Z4 to prioritize ventilation where needed. Keep coil_valve at 0.74 to maintain sensible capacity against hotter OA while avoiding a fan increase. 5) Expected results next 5 min: Higher OA fraction and redistribution should stop CO2 rise and begin reducing CO2 in Z1 and Z3 while keeping all zones within the comfort band near 26°C. Fan power unchanged; pump power unchanged; chiller/coil load modestly higher due to OA, but this is the least-cost way to meet CO2 without the cubic fan penalty. If CO2 in Z1/Z3 does not begin to decline, next step will be a further small OA increase or a slight fan bump.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.72, 0.6, 0.84, 0.46], ""oa_damper"": 0.28, ""coil_valve"": 0.74, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current conditions: All zones are within the 25–27°C band and close to 26°C. Zone 1 (25.4°C) is slightly cool; Zone 2 (25.9°C) slightly cool; Zone 3 (26.0°C) on setpoint; Zone 4 (26.1°C) slightly warm. CO2: Zones 1 and 3 are high (996 ppm) but trending downward; Zone 2 is 970 ppm decreasing; Zone 4 is 869 ppm decreasing. 2) Ventilation strategy: Since CO2 in all zones is decreasing and near targets, reduce outdoor air modestly to cut latent/sensible load and chiller/coil power while keeping CO2 ≤1000 ppm.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zones 1 and 3 have CO2 near the 1000 ppm limit (997 and 995), with small upward or flat trends; Zone 2 is safe; Zone 4 is low. Outdoor air is very hot and humid, so reducing outdoor air reduces coil load significantly. Strategy: make only small, smooth adjustments to avoid oscillations. Reduce outdoor air slightly to cut load while keeping a margin on CO2; keep fan speed steady to avoid reducing absolute ventilation too much; bias zone airflow toward the higher-CO2 zones; slightly reduce coil valve to save pump/chiller energy and allow cooler zones to drift gently toward 26°C. Rationale and trade-offs: (1) OA damper lowered modestly to 0.27 (from 0.30) to reduce cooling load yet maintain CO2 below 1000 ppm given current levels and trends. (2) Fan speed held at 0.78 to preserve absolute ventilation given tight CO2 margins in Zones 1 and 3; reducing fan would cut OA mass flow and risk CO2 exceedance. (3) Coil valve reduced slightly to 0.70 (from 0.72) to shift load away from fan and leverage better pump efficiency while allowing cool zones to rise toward setpoint. (4) Zone dampers rebalanced: keep higher flows to Zones 1 and 3 (near CO2 limit), trim Zone 2 slightly (safe CO2), and nudge Zone 4 up a bit for comfort.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1 is slightly cool (25.4°C), Z2 is on setpoint (26.0°C), Z3 is near setpoint (25.9°C), Z4 is slightly warm (26.1°C). Trends are very small. 2) Assess CO2: Z1=1006 ppm and Z3=1003 ppm exceed the 1000 ppm target (must stay ≤1050). Z2=990 ppm rising (~+1.6 ppm/min) could touch 1000 within this interval. Z4=877 ppm is fine. We need more ventilation, but minimize outdoor air and power. 3) Energy/physics trade-offs: Fan and pump power scale ~cube. Prefer coil (water) over fan for load changes, but outdoor air should be kept minimal due to hot/humid OA (35.4°C, high AH). However, since two zones are already above 1000 ppm, we must increase effective ventilation. The gentlest, energy-aware approach is: modest OA fraction increase plus rebalancing zone dampers toward high-CO2 zones, keeping fan speed steady to avoid cubic power increase. 4) Actuator strategy: - OA damper: small increase from 0.29→0.34 to reduce supply CO2 to all zones while limiting added OA load. - Zone dampers: shift airflow toward high-CO2 zones without large total flow changes: increase Z3 (1003 ppm) and Z2 (990 ppm, rising), reduce Z4 (877 ppm). Keep Z1 damper unchanged to avoid further cooling while relying on higher OA fraction to lower its CO2. Proposed: Z1=0.84 (hold), Z2=0.52 (+0.04), Z3=0.98 (+0.04), Z4=0.32 (−0.08). - Fan speed: hold at 0.74 to avoid cubic power penalty and because rebalancing + OA increase should address CO2. - Coil valve: hold at 0.72; OA increase slightly warms mixed air, which can help nudge Z1 toward 26°C without risking comfort elsewhere; avoiding a coil increase saves pump/chiller energy and prevents overshoot. 5) Power check (relative): P_fan≈0.74^3≈0.405 (relative to nominal), P_pump≈0.72^3≈0.373. We avoid increasing either, favoring small OA/damper redistribution. 6) Expected outcomes next 5–10 min: CO2 in Z1 and Z3 should trend down toward/below 1000 ppm; Z2 should stay ≤1000. Temperatures should remain within 25–27°C with Z1 drifting slightly warmer, others near current values. Changes are smooth and within bounds. If CO2 remains >1000 next interval, consider a further small OA increase or a slight fan bump as a secondary measure while keeping temps in range.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.84, 0.52, 0.98, 0.32], ""oa_damper"": 0.34, ""coil_valve"": 0.72, ""fan_speed"": 0.74}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone dampers: Z1 down, Z2 and Z4 up slightly, Z3 down a touch. 6) Expected outcome over 5 minutes: Zone temps drift toward 26°C with Z1 warming slightly; CO2 remains below 1000 ppm given only ~20% net ventilation reduction and current negative CO2 trends; total power drops significantly due to cubic scaling of fan/pump and reduced OA load. Changes are within bounds and smooth to avoid oscillations."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

We should avoid extra cooling; allow gentle drift toward 26°C. 2) Assess CO2: Z1=1007 ppm (+2.2 ppm/min) and Z2=1002 ppm (+3.1 ppm/min) are above the 1000 ppm limit; Z3=992 ppm (slightly decreasing), Z4=868 ppm (decreasing).

Prefer modest increases in OA fraction and redistribute airflow via zone dampers toward Z1/Z2. Keep changes smooth. To offset added OA heat and prevent overcooling, avoid increasing coil valve; a slight reduction saves pump power and lets zones drift toward 26°C. 4) Control moves: - Increase OA damper moderately (0.28→0.34) to boost ventilation enough to bring Z1/Z2 below 1000 ppm while limiting chiller load. - Reallocate supply: open Z2 more (0.58→0.66) to both cool slightly and ventilate; open Z1 slightly (0.72→0.74) to increase ventilation without overcooling; close Z3 (0.86→0.78) and Z4 (0.52→0.48) to shift air toward zones needing CO2 control and help Z3/Z4 drift toward 26°C. - Hold fan speed at 0.72 to avoid cubic fan power increase. - Slightly reduce coil valve (0.62→0.60) to save pump power and offset the tendency to overcool from increased Z1/Z2 airflow; zones remain within comfort given small 5-min horizon. 5) Expected outcomes over next 5 min: With ~+21% OA fraction and redistribution, Z1/Z2 CO2 trends should turn negative, targeting ~990–995 ppm for Z1 and ~980–990 ppm for Z2.

- Temperature: All zones within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. Z1=25.4 (slightly cool, slowly warming), Z2=26.2 (slightly warm, slowly warming), Z3=25.8 (near target, stable), Z4=26.1 (slightly warm, slowly cooling). No urgent thermal corrections needed; avoid aggressive changes.
- CO2: Z1=1006 ppm (decreasing), Z2=1004 ppm (increasing), Z3=985 ppm (decreasing), Z4=860 ppm (decreasing). Objective is ≤1000 ppm (hard limit 1050). Since Z1 and Z2 are slightly above 1000, priority is to drive them down without large energy penalties.
- Outdoor air: Very hot and humid (34.6°C, high AH), so increasing OA fraction significantly would raise coil load. Prefer to keep OA at minimum needed for CO2 and use airflow redistribution first.
- Energy: Fan/pump power ~ cubic. Avoid fan increases. Favor redistribution of existing airflow and using water-side only if needed. Keep changes smooth.

2) CO2 strategy:
- With current OA fraction (0.34) and fan 0.72, Z2 is trending up. To correct with minimal energy, increase Zone 2 damper to raise its primary airflow (more dilution at same OA fraction), and slightly boost Zone 1. Reduce Zone 3 and 4 dampers (low CO2) to keep total system airflow similar, limiting fan/coil load.
- Keep OA damper at 0.34 for now to avoid extra coil load; redistribution should arrest Z2’s rise and accelerate Z1’s decrease. All zones remain well below the 1050 ppm hard limit.

3) Temperature/comfort implications:
- Increasing Z2 airflow will also increase sensible cooling to Z2, nudging it toward 26.0 from 26.2 (desirable). Slight increase to Z1 airflow may slow its warming; still well within 25–27°C. Reductions in Z3 and Z4 airflow should keep them near 26 without overshooting.
- Keep coil valve and fan speed unchanged to avoid oscillations and cubic power penalties while CO2 trends recover.

4) Power/operational rationale:
- Avoid fan speed increases (cubic penalty). Maintain OA fraction to avoid extra chiller/coil load from hot/humid air. Keep coil valve steady to maintain stable supply temperature while we rebalance zone flows.
- Changes are smooth (≤0.08 damper deltas) to avoid instability.

5) Expected 5-min outcome:
- Z1 and Z2 CO2 trends should flatten or become negative due to higher local ventilation, moving them back toward ≤1000 ppm while staying far below 1050 ppm.
- Zone temperatures remain within band and closer to 26°C, with minimal change in total energy.

6) If next interval shows Z2 CO2 still rising, increment OA slightly (+0.02) as a secondary step; otherwise consider small energy trims (e.g., slight coil or fan reduction) once CO2 margins are secure.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.76, 0.74, 0.72, 0.42], ""oa_damper"": 0.34, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.72}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):

    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to the 26°C target. Z1 is slightly cool (25.5, stable), Z2 and Z4 are slightly warm (26.2 and 26.1, stable), Z3 is near setpoint (25.9, slight rise).
2) CO2/ventilation: Z1 is at 998 ppm with a decreasing trend (-1.8 ppm/min); others are <1000 ppm and also decreasing. Because Z1 is only 2 ppm below the 1000 ppm target, reducing outdoor air or total airflow too much risks pushing it above 1000. Therefore, keep OA roughly unchanged this interval to protect the CO2 margin.
3) Outdoor conditions: Very hot/humid outside (34.1°C, high moisture). OA is energetically expensive, so we will only trim it once CO2 margin improves.
4) Energy strategy and trade-offs: Use water-side (coil) slightly more and fan slightly less to reduce total power (fan power ~ f^3 is expensive; pump is typically more efficient). Maintain similar net cooling Q using Q ≈ k_air*f + k_water*w.
   - Reduce fan_speed from 0.69 → 0.67 (small, smooth). Approx fan power change: (0.67/0.69)^3 ≈ 0.916 (~8–9% fan power reduction).
   - Slightly increase coil_valve 0.59 → 0.60 to keep Q about constant despite lower f; pump power increase ≈ (0.60/0.59)^3 ≈ +5% (typically cheaper than fan).
   - Keep OA damper at 0.38 to avoid CO2 rising above 1000 given the very small margin in Z1; we’ll reassess next interval and then reduce OA if CO2 margin grows (<990 ppm).
5) Zone airflow distribution: Avoid overcooling Z1 (already slightly cool) but maintain its ventilation share due to CO2 risk → keep Z1 damper at 0.80. Bias a little more air to Z3 (slight warming trend) while keeping Z2 and Z4 as-is: Z3 to 0.60; Z2 at 0.86; Z4 at 0.36. Changes are small to avoid oscillations.
6) Constraints check: All actuators within bounds; changes are smooth; OA minimized subject to CO2 constraint this interval.
7) Expected outcome (next 5 min): Temps remain near 26°C (Z2/Z4 drift slightly cooler or hold; Z1 should stay near 25.5–25.7 due to reduced fan), CO2 remains ≤1000 in all zones (Z1 trend should remain near flat to slightly negative with OA unchanged), and total electrical power is reduced primarily via lower fan power.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 0.86, 0.6, 0.36], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.67}","{

CO2 is below 1000 ppm in all zones, but Zone 1 is tight at 993 ppm. Outdoor air is hot and humid, so reducing OA lowers coil/chiller load and latent load. Control strategy for this step: 1) Trim outdoor air moderately to reduce load but keep Zone 1 safely ≤1000 ppm; avoid large simultaneous reductions in both OA and Zone 1 airflow. 2) Hold coil valve steady to avoid overreacting; load is expected to drop with less OA. 3) Slightly reduce fan speed for cubic power savings while keeping ventilation adequate. 4) Keep zone dampers unchanged to preserve ventilation distribution to Zone 1 and avoid oscillations. Expected effects: OA absolute intake drops ~13% versus previous (0.67*0.38 → 0.65*0.34), which should keep Zone 1 CO2 within limit over the next 5 minutes.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Parse current state and objectives:
- Comfort target 26C, band 25–27C. Zone temps: Z1 25.5 (slightly cool, flat trend), Z2 26.2 (slightly warm, flat), Z3 26.0 (on target, slight +0.01 C/min), Z4 26.2 (slightly warm, +0.01 C/min). All within band.
- CO2: Z1 997 ppm rising ~0.8 ppm/min; in 5 min would reach ~1001 ppm if nothing changes (just above the 1000 target but far below 1050 hard cap). Z2 988 (+0.5/min), Z3 983 (+0.7/min), Z4 841 (+0.1/min).
- Outdoor: 34C and humid; OA air is expensive to condition. Prefer minimizing OA fraction; use airflow redistribution before OA increases.
- Current actuators: zone dampers [0.8, 0.86, 0.6, 0.36], OA 0.34, coil 0.60, fan 0.65.

2) Strategy considerations:
- To prevent Z1 CO2 from exceeding 1000 while minimizing energy: first reallocate supply air toward Z1 (via its damper) and reduce other zones’ dampers (they have lower CO2). This boosts Z1 ventilation without increasing OA fraction or fan speed.
- Avoid increasing fan speed due to cubic power. Keep OA as low as possible because OA at 34C/humid increases coil/chiller load.
- Thermal: Z1 is a bit cool; increasing its airflow could overcool it, so slightly reduce coil_valve to raise supply-air temperature a bit, saving pump/chiller power and pulling Z1 toward 26C. Other zones are slightly warm; modest coil reduction should still keep all within 25–27C over 5 minutes.

3) Proposed adjustments and rationale:
- Zone dampers: increase Z1 from 0.80→0.90 to increase its ventilation; decrease Z2 0.86→0.80, Z3 0.60→0.56, Z4 0.36→0.32 to shift air toward Z1 while maintaining smooth changes (<=0.10 steps).
- OA damper: keep at 0.34 to minimize OA load; rely on redistribution for Z1 CO2. Given the combined ~+12–15% relative ventilation to Z1 from damper shifts (and reduced cooling intensity via coil), Z1 CO2 rise should be tempered, keeping it at or near 1000 without raising OA.
- Fan speed: hold at 0.65 to avoid cubic fan power increase.
- Coil valve: reduce 0.60→0.58 to save pump power and slightly warm supply air. This helps avoid overcooling Z1 despite more airflow and keeps all zones within band; Z2/3/4 may drift slightly warmer but remain well within 27C.

4) Power trade-offs check:
- Fan power unchanged (f=0.65).
- Pump power decreases with w^3: 0.60^3=0.216 vs 0.58^3≈0.195 (≈10% pump power reduction).
- OA fraction unchanged, avoiding extra chiller load.

5) Constraint checks and smoothness:
- All commands within bounds: zone dampers [0.05,1.0], oa [0.05,1.0], coil [0.06,1.0], fan [0.45,1.4]. Changes are moderate to avoid oscillations.
- Comfort maintained in 25–27C; Z1 nudged toward 26C; others stay within band.
- CO2: Z1 receives a meaningful ventilation increase via redistribution without raising OA; expected to keep Z1 at or below ~1000 ppm over the interval, with ample safety to 1050 ppm.

6) Finalize values (clipped to bounds where needed):
- zone_dampers: [0.90, 0.80, 0.56, 0.32]
- oa_damper: 0.34
- coil_valve: 0.58

- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort check: All zones are within 25–27°C.

1) Comfort status and short-term forecast (5 min):
- Z1: 25.5°C (slightly cool), flat trend; safe.
- Z2: 26.2°C (slightly warm), flat trend; safe.
- Z3: 26.1°C (near target), flat trend; safe.
- Z4: 26.4°C (warmest), rising ~0.02°C/min → ~+0.1°C in 5 min (to ~26.5°C); still in band but drifting away from 26°C.
2) CO2 status:
- Z1: 999 ppm, trending down (-1.7 ppm/min) at OA=0.38; near the 1000 ppm target. Any large OA cut risks reversing the trend.
- Z2: 998 ppm, trending down (-1.2 ppm/min).
- Z3: 991 ppm, trending down (-1.3 ppm/min).
- Z4: 854 ppm, slightly rising (+0.6 ppm/min) but far below limits.
3) Strategy for OA/ventilation:
- Reduce outdoor air slightly to lower coil/chiller load and total power, but keep Z1 safely ≤1000 ppm. A modest step from 0.38 → 0.34 should keep Z1’s CO2 near-flat to slightly negative, avoiding a spike while saving energy. Larger cuts are risky given Z1=999 ppm.
- Rebalance zone dampers to route a bit more supply (and thus OA portion) to Z1 and Z2 to protect CO2 while allowing OA fraction to drop.
4) Air vs. water (power trade-offs):
- Fan and pump power scale ~cube. Avoid increasing fan speed; use zone damper redistribution first. Keep coil valve roughly steady; OA reduction already lowers load, and Z4 can be handled by giving it more airflow. This avoids a pump increase and prevents overcooling Z1.
5) Zone damper adjustments for comfort and CO2:
- Z1: slight increase to bolster ventilation at lower OA (0.96 → 0.98).
- Z2: slight increase to protect CO2 and trim temp (0.88 → 0.90).
- Z3: slight decrease to free airflow to others while staying comfortable and within CO2 limits (0.68 → 0.65).
- Z4: increase to counter its warm drift (0.18 → 0.24) without needing higher fan or coil.
6) Fan and coil:
- Keep fan at 0.65 to avoid reducing total ventilation given tight CO2 in Z1.
- Keep coil at 0.56; reduced OA cuts load and extra Z4 airflow should correct its temperature without extra pump power.
7) Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes:
- CO2: Z1 should remain ≲1000 ppm with near-flat trend; Z2, Z3 remain below 1000; Z4 remains well below. None approach 1050.
- Temperature: Z4 drift checked toward ~26.3–26.4°C; other zones remain within 25–27°C, near 26°C.
- Energy: OA reduction lowers coil/chiller power; no fan increase; pump unchanged; net electrical power reduced while maintaining constraints.
All values are within actuator bounds and changes are smooth to avoid oscillations.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.98, 0.9, 0.65, 0.24], ""oa_damper"": 0.34, ""coil_valve"": 0.56, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort status: Z1=25.5°C (slightly cool, stable), Z2=26.2°C (slightly warm, slowly rising), Z3=26.0°C (on target), Z4=26.5°C (warm, slowly rising). All within 25–27°C but Z2/Z4 need a bit more cooling; Z1 can drift up slightly. 2) CO2 status/trend: Z1=1011 ppm (+2.2 ppm/min) and Z2=1011 ppm (+2.4 ppm/min) are above 1000 and rising; must improve ventilation to drive them ≤1000 and ensure never >1050. Z3=987 (falling), Z4=858 (low). 3) Strategy: Increase outdoor air fraction to arrest and reverse CO2 rise in Z1/Z2, while biasing airflow toward Z2 and Z4 for cooling. Avoid fan speed increases due to cubic power penalty; prefer adding cooling via coil (pump energy) which is typically cheaper for the same load. Keep changes smooth. 4) Actuator choices: - OA damper: raise from 0.34→0.42 (+24% OA fraction) to bring Z1/Z2 CO2 below 1000 over the next interval(s). - Zone dampers: reduce Z1 slightly (0.98→0.96) to ease overcooling while OA increase still improves its CO2; increase Z2 (0.90→0.96) and Z4 (0.24→0.30) for more cooling and ventilation where needed; trim Z3 (0.65→0.62) since it’s on target and its CO2 is decreasing. This redistributes supply and OA toward the zones that need it without extra fan power. - Coil valve: modest increase 0.56→0.60 to offset the added sensible/latent load from higher OA and the extra flow to Z2/Z4; this leverages cheaper pump power vs fan. - Fan speed: hold at 0.65 to avoid cubic fan power increase; distribution is handled via dampers. 5) Expected outcomes (5–10 min): Z1/Z2 CO2 trends should flatten then turn negative due to ~24% OA increase plus higher zone flow (Z2). Temperatures: Z2 and Z4 should cool toward 26°C; Z1 should stay near 25.5–25.8°C (slight damper reduction counteracts colder coil), Z3 remains near 26°C. 6) Constraints check: All setpoints within bounds, OA increased only because CO2>1000, changes are moderate to prevent oscillations, and power is minimized by avoiding fan increases and using coil/water-side first.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.96, 0.96, 0.62, 0.3], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1=25.5°C (slightly cool, warming slowly), Z2=26.3°C (slightly warm, warming slowly), Z3=26.1°C (stable), Z4=26.6°C (warm). Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.5°C, high moisture), so extra OA raises cooling/latent load. Step 2: Assess CO2. Z1=1007 ppm, Z2=1008 ppm (both just above 1000, trending down 0.6–0.7 ppm/min); Z3=976, Z4=852 (comfortable). We must reduce Z1/Z2 CO2 while minimizing OA. Current trends imply they won’t drop below 1000 within 5 minutes without some increase in ventilation. Step 3: Energy trade-off. Fan power ~ f^3 and pump power ~ w^3; increasing fan is expensive. Prefer using distribution (zone dampers) and minimal OA increase to target the high-CO2 zones, keeping fan steady to avoid cubic penalty and oscillations. Increasing coil (water flow) is cheaper than fan for sensible load, but here the driver for CO2 is ventilation; however high OA also increases latent/chiller load, so keep OA bump modest. Step 4: Control strategy. - Reallocate airflow: fully open Z1 and Z2 dampers to prioritize ventilation where CO2 is high; trim Z3 (already fine) to free up flow; slightly open Z4 to improve its temperature (26.6°C). - OA damper: modest increase from 0.42 to 0.50 to accelerate CO2 reduction in Z1/Z2 while avoiding a large latent load jump. - Fan: hold at 0.65 to avoid the cubic power increase. - Coil: hold at 0.60; the modest OA increase will slightly warm SA before coil, which helps prevent Z1 from overcooling while additional airflow to Z4 addresses its warmth. Step 5: Expected outcomes next 5 min. - CO2: Z1/Z2 decline rate increases (due to 19% more OA fraction and more local airflow), pushing them closer to/below 1000 without approaching the 1050 limit; Z3/Z4 remain well below 1000. - Temperature: Z1 stays within band (slight risk of minor cooling offset by warmer OA); Z2 and Z4 should drift toward 26°C from increased local airflow; Z3 remains near 26°C despite reduced damper. Step 6: Power. Fan power unchanged; pump power unchanged; only OA fraction increased (limited to minimize chiller/latent impact). Smooth changes applied to avoid oscillation. If Z1/Z2 CO2 remain >1000 next interval, plan is to nudge OA up slightly or add a small fan increase while keeping coil adjustments minimal.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.4], ""oa_damper"": 0.5, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state vs. targets: All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band. Zone 2 (26.3°C, rising) and Zone 4 (26.6°C, flat) need a bit more cooling toward 26°C. Zone 1 (25.6°C, slightly cool) can drift up a bit. Zone 3 (26.1°C, slightly warm and rising) needs just a light touch to avoid overshoot. CO2: Z1=989, Z2=992, Z3=964, Z4=833 ppm; all are below 1000 ppm and trending downward. Outdoor air is hot and humid (33.6°C, high absolute humidity), so we should minimize OA to reduce latent/sensible load. 2) Ventilation/OA strategy: Current OA damper is 0.5 with fan 0.65, giving an indicative OA flow ∝ 0.5×0.65=0.325. CO2 is dropping at roughly 2–3 ppm/min in the worst zones at this OA flow. Reduce OA to cut chiller/coil load, but keep enough dilution to maintain CO2 ≤1000 with a negative or near-zero trend. Choose OA damper = 0.35 while keeping fan ≈0.65 gives OA flow ≈0.35×0.65=0.2275, ~70% of previous. This should preserve a slight negative CO2 trend in Zones 1–2 (which were near 1000) while materially reducing outdoor latent/sensible load. 3) Air vs. water-side cooling: To cool Zones 2 and 4, prefer increasing water flow (pump/coils) over fan (cubic power; pump energy is typically cheaper). Increase coil_valve moderately (0.6→0.68) to lower supply air temperature. Keep fan_speed at 0.65 for now to maintain total OA volume after reducing OA fraction and to avoid starving ventilation in the near-threshold zones. 4) Zone airflow redistribution (damper setpoints): - Zone 1 (25.6°C, slightly cool): reduce damper from 1.0→0.8 to avoid overcooling and allow drift toward 26°C. - Zone 2 (26.3°C, warm): keep damper at 1.0 (max) to increase local cooling and ventilation share. - Zone 3 (26.1°C, slightly warm but rising): trim damper 0.5→0.45 to prevent overshoot given colder coil air. - Zone 4 (26.6°C, warmest): increase damper 0.4→0.65 to deliver more cooling. 5) Power/efficiency check: Fan power unchanged at 0.65 (avoid cubic penalty). Pump power rises with 0.68^3 vs 0.6^3, but this is typically cheaper than increasing fan. OA reduction cuts coil/chiller load, especially latent, improving total power. 6) Constraint/safety check: All actuators within bounds. Changes are moderate to avoid oscillations. CO2 should remain below 1000 ppm with the reduced OA (monitor next interval; if any zone approaches 1000 with a positive trend, slightly raise OA or maintain fan). 7) Expected outcomes for next 5 minutes: Zone 2 and Zone 4 move closer to 26°C due to higher local flow and colder coil air; Zone 1 drifts slightly upward; Zone 3 holds near 26°C. CO2 trends remain slightly negative or near flat in Zones 1–2 and clearly negative elsewhere, keeping ≤1000 ppm.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 1.0, 0.45, 0.65], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.68, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

Outdoor air is hot and humid (33.6°C, high absolute humidity), so we should minimize OA to reduce latent/sensible load. 2) Ventilation/OA strategy: Current OA damper is 0.5 with fan 0.65, giving an indicative OA flow ∝ 0.5×0.65=0.325. CO2 is dropping at roughly 2–3 ppm/min in the worst zones at this OA flow. Reduce OA to cut chiller/coil load, but keep enough dilution to maintain CO2 ≤1000 with a negative or near-zero trend. Choose OA damper = 0.35 while keeping fan ≈0.65 gives OA flow ≈0.35×0.65=0.2275, ~70% of previous. This should preserve a slight negative CO2 trend in Zones 1–2 (which were near 1000) while materially reducing outdoor latent/sensible load. 3) Air vs. water-side cooling: To cool Zones 2 and 4, prefer increasing water flow (pump/coils) over fan (cubic power; pump energy is typically cheaper). Increase coil_valve moderately (0.6→0.68) to lower supply air temperature. Keep fan_speed at 0.65 for now to maintain total OA volume after reducing OA fraction and to avoid starving ventilation in the near-threshold zones. 4) Zone airflow redistribution (damper setpoints): - Zone 1 (25.6°C, slightly cool): reduce damper from 1.0→0.8 to avoid overcooling and allow drift toward 26°C. - Zone 2 (26.3°C, warm): keep damper at 1.0 (max) to increase local cooling and ventilation share. - Zone 3 (26.1°C, slightly warm but rising): trim damper 0.5→0.45 to prevent overshoot given colder coil air. - Zone 4 (26.6°C, warmest): increase damper 0.4→0.65 to deliver more cooling. 5) Power/efficiency check: Fan power unchanged at 0.65 (avoid cubic penalty). Pump power rises with 0.68^3 vs 0.6^3, but this is typically cheaper than increasing fan. OA reduction cuts coil/chiller load, especially latent, improving total power. 6) Constraint/safety check: All actuators within bounds. Changes are moderate to avoid oscillations. CO2 should remain below 1000 ppm with the reduced OA (monitor next interval; if any zone approaches 1000 with a positive trend, slightly raise OA or maintain fan). 7) Expected outcomes for next 5 minutes: Zone 2 and Zone 4 move closer to 26°C due to higher local flow and colder coil air; Zone 1 drifts slightly upward; Zone 3 holds near 26°C. CO2 trends remain slightly negative or near flat in Zones 1–2 and clearly negative elsewhere, keeping ≤1000 ppm."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess zone states vs targets: All temps are within 25–27°C. Z2 (26.4°C, warming) and Z4 (26.5°C, slightly cooling) are above 26°C; Z3 (26.2°C, warming slightly) is near target; Z1 (25.6°C, warming slightly) is a bit cool but within band. CO2: Z1=1005 ppm and rising (+2.9 ppm/min), Z2=1001 ppm and rising (+1.7 ppm/min); both are just above 1000 ppm and trending upward. Z3=971 ppm and rising slowly; Z4=828 ppm and decreasing. Outdoor air is hot and humid (33.6°C, high AH), so extra OA increases cooling/dehumidification load; minimize OA but ensure CO2 compliance. 2) Ventilation strategy: Because Z1 and Z2 are >1000 ppm and rising, increase OA slightly to reverse the trend while avoiding a large energy penalty. Bump OA damper from 0.35 to 0.42 (moderate, smooth step) to drive CO2 downward within the next interval and stay comfortably below 1050 ppm. 3) Load/cooling strategy with power trade-offs: Prefer water-side (coil_valve) adjustments over fan due to cubic power scaling and typically better pump efficiency. Increase coil_valve from 0.68 to 0.72 to offset added OA load and nudge zones toward 26°C (especially helping Z2>26 and stabilizing Z4 near 26). Keep fan_speed at 0.65 to avoid cubic fan power increase. Relative power: P_fan ~ 0.65^3 ≈ 0.275 P_ref (unchanged); P_pump increases from 0.68^3≈0.314 to 0.72^3≈0.373 (~+19%), which is preferred over raising fan. 4) Airflow balancing via zone dampers: Maintain Z2 at 1.0 (needs cooling and dilution). Keep Z1 at 0.8 to avoid overcooling it; rely primarily on raised OA for CO2 there. Slightly throttle Z3 (0.45→0.40) and Z4 (0.65→0.60) to shift available capacity and fresh air share toward Z2 (and indirectly Z1) without raising fan speed. These are small, smooth changes. 5) Constraint check and outcomes: All actuators within bounds; changes are moderate to avoid oscillations. Expected effects in next 5 min: Z1 CO2 should stop rising and begin to decrease toward ≤1000 ppm; Z2 CO2 likewise. Temperatures: Z2 should cool slightly toward 26; Z4 should stabilize closer to 26 (slower cooling with a touch less airflow but cooler supply); Z3 may warm slightly from damper reduction but coil boost should keep it near 26.2 and within band. Energy: OA increase is minimized to what’s needed for IAQ; fan power held constant; water-side used for fine-tuning. If Z1/Z2 CO2 remain above 1000 ppm next interval, increment OA a bit more; if Z1 drifts cool (<25.5°C), reduce its damper slightly.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 1.0, 0.4, 0.6], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 0.72, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z2 is 26.5°C (needs a bit more cooling). Z3/Z4 are comfortable, slightly cool, and over-ventilated (CO2 falling). Outdoors is hot/humid (33.5°C), so outdoor air (OA) increases coil/chiller load. 2) Energy priorities: Because fan and pump power scale cubically, avoid increasing fan speed; prefer coil (water) tweaks over fan for added cooling. Also reduce OA where safely possible to cut coil load. 3) OA damper: Reduce OA slightly from 0.41 to 0.38 to trim coil load. With Z1’s current trend (~+0.1 ppm/min at OA 0.41), a ~7% OA reduction should still keep 5‑min CO2 well below 1000 ppm (approx +1 ppm → ~998 ppm). Z2 at 991 ppm remains safe. This meets the goal of minimizing OA while keeping CO2 ≤ 1000. 4) Coil valve: Hold at 0.82. The reduced OA fraction lowers mixed-air temperature and latent load, effectively increasing sensible capacity at the same coil setting. This should help Z2 cool without extra pump power. 5) Fan speed: Keep at 0.65. Lowering would risk CO2, raising is energetically costly (cubic) and unnecessary given the OA reduction and damper rebalancing. 6) Zone dampers (redistribution): Keep Z2 at 1.0 (needs more cooling). Slightly close Z3 from 0.55→0.50 and Z4 from 0.45→0.40 to redirect more supply to Z1/Z2. Keep Z1 at 0.90 to avoid overcooling while its CO2 remains predicted ≤1000. This redistribution should pull Z2 toward 26.0°C while allowing Z3/Z4 to drift gently toward 26.0°C and keep their CO2 well below limit. 7) Smoothness/limits: All changes are small to avoid oscillation and respect bounds. 8) Expected outcomes next 5 min: Z2 temperature decreases toward target; Z1 stays within 25–27°C (may cool slightly but should remain >25°C); CO2 in all zones stays ≤1000 ppm (Z1 ~998 ppm). Total power drops via reduced OA (less coil/chiller load) with no fan increase and no added pump power.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 1.0, 0.5, 0.4], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.82, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

Outdoors is hot/humid (33.5°C), so outdoor air (OA) increases coil/chiller load. 2) Energy priorities: Because fan and pump power scale cubically, avoid increasing fan speed; prefer coil (water) tweaks over fan for added cooling. Also reduce OA where safely possible to cut coil load. 3) OA damper: Reduce OA slightly from 0.41 to 0.38 to trim coil load. With Z1’s current trend (~+0.1 ppm/min at OA 0.41), a ~7% OA reduction should still keep 5‑min CO2 well below 1000 ppm (approx +1 ppm → ~998 ppm). Z2 at 991 ppm remains safe. This meets the goal of minimizing OA while keeping CO2 ≤ 1000. 4) Coil valve: Hold at 0.82. The reduced OA fraction lowers mixed-air temperature and latent load, effectively increasing sensible capacity at the same coil setting. This should help Z2 cool without extra pump power. 5) Fan speed: Keep at 0.65. Lowering would risk CO2, raising is energetically costly (cubic) and unnecessary given the OA reduction and damper rebalancing. 6) Zone dampers (redistribution): Keep Z2 at 1.0 (needs more cooling). Slightly close Z3 from 0.55→0.50 and Z4 from 0.45→0.40 to redirect more supply to Z1/Z2. Keep Z1 at 0.90 to avoid overcooling while its CO2 remains predicted ≤1000. This redistribution should pull Z2 toward 26.0°C while allowing Z3/Z4 to drift gently toward 26.0°C and keep their CO2 well below limit. 7) Smoothness/limits: All changes are small to avoid oscillation and respect bounds. 8) Expected outcomes next 5 min: Z2 temperature decreases toward target; Z1 stays within 25–27°C (may cool slightly but should remain >25°C); CO2 in all zones stays ≤1000 ppm (Z1 ~998 ppm). Total power drops via reduced OA (less coil/chiller load) with no fan increase and no added pump power."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1 – Comfort check: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z2=26.5, Z3=26.4, Z4=26.3 are slightly warm and need a touch more cooling; Z1=25.8 is slightly cool (still in band). Temperature trends are ~flat, so small, smooth adjustments are appropriate.
Step 2 – CO2/ventilation: Z1 is at 1002 ppm and rising (+0.8 ppm/min), exceeding the 1000 ppm target; Z2 is 995 ppm and rising (+0.7 ppm/min). We must increase effective ventilation, prioritizing minimal OA increases by (a) redistributing airflow towards zones with higher CO2 and (b) making a modest OA fraction increase to bend trends downward while keeping energy low.
Step 3 – Energy strategy: Avoid large fan changes (P_fan ∝ f^3). Favor coil/water-side adjustments (typically cheaper than fan for the same load). Keep OA as low as possible but increase just enough for CO2 control. Use zone dampers to allocate airflow to warmer/higher-CO2 zones.
Step 4 – Actuator choices (smooth changes from previous):
- Zone dampers: raise Z1 slightly (CO2 relief, accepting minor extra cooling), keep Z2 at max for cooling and CO2, nudge up Z3 and Z4 for small extra cooling. New: [0.95, 1.0, 0.55, 0.45] from [0.9, 1.0, 0.5, 0.4].
- OA damper: modest increase to lift ventilation to Z1/Z2 while limiting chiller load: 0.44 from 0.38.
- Coil valve: slight increase to offset the extra OA heat and help pull Z2–Z4 toward 26°C without raising fan power: 0.84 from 0.82.
- Fan speed: hold at 0.65 to avoid cubic power penalty and prevent over-ventilating.
Step 5 – Expected outcomes: Increased OA plus more Z1/Z2 airflow should arrest and reverse CO2 rise in Z1 and keep Z2 at/under 1000 ppm, while Z3/Z4 get a small cooling boost toward 26°C. Changes are within bounds and smooth to avoid oscillations.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of reasoning: 1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Zone 2 is warm (26.5°C) and needs a bit more cooling; Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.8°C) and should not get extra cooling. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is at 1000 ppm and rising, Zone 2 at 995 ppm and rising; we need a modest outdoor-air increase to stop further rise while avoiding unnecessary OA. 3) Energy: Avoid fan increases (cubic penalty); prefer small coil (water) adjustment and redistribute air via dampers. 4) Actions: a) Slightly increase OA damper to 0.42 to flatten/reduce CO2 in Zones 1–2. b) Keep fan speed at 0.65 to avoid a cubic fan power increase. c) Nudge coil valve up to 0.86 to deliver a bit more sensible cooling (cheaper than fan) and counteract the small OA increase. d) Rebalance dampers: keep Z2 at 1.0 to prioritize cooling and dilution; slightly reduce Z1 damper to 0.90 so it can drift toward 26.0 without worsening CO2 too much; keep Z3 at 0.60 (near target); trim Z4 to 0.35 (low CO2, saves airflow/energy). 5) Smoothness: All changes are modest relative to previous settings to avoid oscillations. Expected outcome next interval: Zone 2 should move closer to 26°C; Zone 1 should remain near 26°C; CO2 in Zones 1–2 should stabilize at or below 1000 ppm without exceeding limits; total power minimized by avoiding fan increases and keeping OA only slightly above prior.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 1.0, 0.6, 0.35], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 0.86, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary: Zone 1 CO2 is near the 1000 ppm limit and rising; temperatures are within 25–27°C and generally drifting slightly down.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z1=25.6°C (slightly cool, drifting down −0.01°C/min). Z2–Z4=26.2°C, each trending slightly down. We want to reduce cooling slightly to drift toward 26°C and save energy. 2) CO2 check: Z1=1000 ppm and rising (+1.2 ppm/min) → at target limit; must arrest/invert the rise. Z2–Z4 are safely below 1000 ppm with modest upward trends. 3) Energy strategy: Avoid fan speed increases due to cubic penalty; adjust coil_valve (water-side) first to trim load and energy. Keep OA low but increase only as needed to control CO2. Use zone dampers to redistribute airflow/ventilation toward Z1 without raising total fan power. 4) Actions chosen: - Reduce coil_valve from 0.84→0.81 to cut pump/chiller load and ease cooling (0.84^3≈0.593 to 0.81^3≈0.531, ~10% reduction). - Hold fan_speed at 0.60 to avoid cubic fan penalty and preserve ventilation capacity. - Slightly increase oa_damper 0.28→0.32 to provide just enough extra outdoor air to stop Z1 CO2 from climbing while still minimizing OA. - Redistribute zone airflow: Open Z1 damper 0.92→1.00; slightly trim others (Z2: 0.84→0.82, Z3: 0.58→0.56, Z4: 0.40→0.38) to bias more total supply (and OA share) to Z1 without raising fan speed. Combined effect for Z1 ventilation: OA fraction +14% and Z1 damper +8.7% → roughly +24% OA delivery to Z1, expected to stabilize or reduce CO2 below 1000 ppm. 5) Expected outcomes next 5 min: - Temperatures: Coil reduction plus slightly reduced flow to Z2–Z4 should nudge them toward ~26.1–26.3°C (closer to target). Z1 may remain ~25.5–25.6°C but should not drift colder due to warmer coil; overall stays in band. - CO2: Z1 trend should flatten or reverse, keeping ≤1000 ppm and well under 1050 ppm; others remain safely below 1000. 6) Smoothness/constraints: All changes are modest, within bounds, and avoid oscillations.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.82, 0.56, 0.38], ""oa_damper"": 0.32, ""coil_valve"": 0.81, ""fan_speed"": 0.6}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort vs. target 26°C: Z1=25.5°C (slightly cool, drifting down -0.01°C/min), Z2=26.0°C (on target, slight cooling), Z3=26.1°C (stable), Z4=26.2°C (stable). All within 25–27°C. Avoid further cooling in Z1 and unnecessary capacity overall. 2) Assess CO2 vs. 1000 ppm: Z1=995 ppm (decreasing -0.5 ppm/min; close to limit, keep ventilation), Z2=959 ppm (decreasing), Z3=961 ppm (increasing +0.5 ppm/min; watch), Z4=833 ppm (increasing but low). Because Z1 is near the limit, do NOT reduce total OA or fan speed this step. 3) Power strategy: Use water-side first (cheaper than fan per cubic scaling). Reduce coil_valve modestly to trim capacity and prevent overcooling, while maintaining airflow and OA fraction to protect CO2. Keep fan_speed steady to avoid CO2 swings and oscillations. Keep OA damper at current minimum feasible for CO2 (32%) since Z1 is near the threshold and outdoor air is hot/humid (raising OA would increase cooling/dehumidification load). 4) Zone airflow distribution: Keep Z1 damper high to preserve its ventilation (avoid CO2 creep back up) and rely on slightly warmer supply (from coil reduction) to curb its cooling. Slightly open Z3 damper to counter its rising CO2 and give a touch more cooling/ventilation. Hold Z2 and Z4 dampers steady for stability. 5) Expected effects over next 5 min: Coil trim (0.74→0.70) slightly warms supply; Z1 cooling trend should diminish toward ~0, stabilizing ~25.5–25.7°C while its CO2 continues decreasing or flattens but stays <1000. Z3 added airflow should slow/stop CO2 rise (projected <970 ppm) while temp remains ~26.1–26.3°C. Z2 likely ~25.95–26.1°C; Z4 ~26.2–26.3°C. All remain 25–27°C, CO2 safely ≤1000 ppm. 6) Power impact: Pump power drops ~15% (0.74^3≈0.405 to 0.70^3≈0.343). Fan power unchanged (0.6^3≈0.216). OA fraction unchanged to avoid extra latent/sensible load. Changes are small to avoid oscillations. 7) Next-step watchouts: If Z1 CO2 keeps falling and temps rise, consider lowering OA or fan slightly next interval; if Z3 CO2 still climbs, consider a small OA increase or further local damper tweak.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.78, 0.56, 0.36], ""oa_damper"": 0.32, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 0.6}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z1 is a bit cool (25.4, drifting down). Z2 is on target (26.0, slightly cooling). Z3 (26.1) and Z4 (26.2) are slightly warm but stable to slightly cooling. We can gently reduce cooling to nudge temps toward 26 without overshooting. 2) CO2 status and OA strategy: Z1 CO2 is highest at 994 ppm with a slight decreasing trend (-0.2 ppm/min) at OA=0.32 and fan=0.60. Others are 836–962 ppm with safe trends. To minimize OA while keeping ≤1000 ppm, make a small OA reduction to 0.30 (about -6%) to reduce load without flipping Z1 into a strong positive trend.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.4°C) and still drifting down; Zones 2–4 are near/slightly above 26°C with small negative trends, so they are gently cooling. 2) Assess CO2: Zone 1 is at 1000 ppm and rising (~+0.7 ppm/min). We must keep ≤1000 ppm; therefore ventilation to Zone 1 must effectively increase over the next 5 minutes. Other zones are safely below 1000 ppm. 3) Ventilation/energy trade-offs: • Avoid fan increases due to cubic power penalty. • Prefer minimal OA increases (OA raises coil/chiller load), but here OA must rise to stabilize Zone 1 CO2. • Reallocating more air to Zone 1 via its damper would cool it further (undesirable). So use a modest OA increase and small damper trims to reduce unnecessary cooling elsewhere. 4) Chosen adjustments: • Raise OA damper from 0.30 → 0.35 to increase absolute outdoor air. • Keep fan at 0.60 to avoid cubic power increase. • Slightly reduce coil valve from 0.64 → 0.62 to save pump power and ease overcooling, accepting a slightly warmer supply (still within comfort for all zones). • Trim zone dampers slightly: Z1 0.90 → 0.88 to slow its cooling; Z2 0.70 → 0.68; Z3 0.56 → 0.54; Z4 0.50 → 0.48 to reduce unnecessary cooling and shift minimal flow away from zones already near/above setpoint. 5) Check that Zone 1 OA delivery increases despite its small damper reduction: baseline OA-to-Z1 ∝ 0.60*0.30*0.90=0.162; proposed ∝ 0.60*0.35*0.88=0.1848 (~+14%). This should stop/reverse the CO2 rise while letting Zone 1 warm slightly toward 26°C. 6) Power/constraints: • Fan remains 0.60 (P_fan ≈ 0.60^3=0.216·P_ref). • Pump drops from 0.64^3≈0.262 to 0.62^3≈0.238 (≈9% pump saving). OA increase is the minimum needed for CO2 control. 7) Smoothness/bounds: All changes are small and within actuator limits, reducing oscillation risk. Reassess CO2 and zone temps next interval; if Zone 1 CO2 still trends up, consider a further small OA tweak; if temps drift high, nudge coil or dampers accordingly.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.68, 0.54, 0.48], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.62, ""fan_speed"": 0.6}","{

Z1 is slightly cool (25.3, drifting down), Z2 slightly cool (25.8, drifting down), Z3 on setpoint, Z4 slightly high (26.1) but drifting down. This suggests we can gently reduce cooling to move zones toward 26 without risking overheating.
2) Assess CO2/ventilation: Z1 is the tightest at 995 ppm but trending down; others are ≤ 965 ppm and trending down. We can modestly reduce outdoor-air (OA) while remaining ≤ 1000 ppm and well below the 1050 ppm hard limit.
3) Energy strategy: Reduce coil valve first (pump-side is typically more efficient than boosting fan), then small fan/OA tweaks. Avoid big fan increases; we are reducing loads, so small decreases are acceptable. Minimize OA to reduce latent/sensible load and chiller/coil power, but keep CO2 safe.
4) Setpoints chosen:
   - Coil valve: small decrease (0.62→0.58) to ease cooling, letting slightly cool zones drift up toward 26 and cutting pump/chiller load.
   - Fan speed: slight decrease (0.60→0.58) to save fan power with minimal impact on CO2 or comfort.
   - OA damper: reduce (0.35→0.30) to minimize outdoor load. With the small fan decrease, OA flow drops ~17%, but CO2 in Z1 should still trend down given current margin.
   - Zone dampers: keep Z1 high (0.88) to preserve ventilation in the most CO2-constrained zone; shave Z2 and Z3 slightly (0.68→0.66 and 0.54→0.52) to avoid overcooling; keep Z4 unchanged (0.48) since it’s near target and drifting down.
5) Safety/limits check: All commands are within bounds; changes are smooth to avoid oscillations. Expected outcomes next 5 min: CO2 remains ≤ 1000 ppm (Z1 continues decreasing slightly), temperatures nudge toward 26°C without leaving the 25–27°C band, and total electrical power decreases due to reduced coil, fan, and OA load.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.88, 0.66, 0.52, 0.48], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.58, ""fan_speed"": 0.58}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Zone 1 is a bit cool (25.3°C) and still drifting slightly cooler; Zones 2–4 are near 26°C with tiny cooling trends. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is at 1001 ppm and rising (~+1 ppm/min), so it needs more ventilation to get back ≤1000 ppm. Other zones are <1000 ppm with moderate upward trends, leaving room to trim their airflow slightly. 3) Energy/physics trade-offs: Avoid increasing fan speed because P_fan ∝ f^3; prefer shifting existing airflow toward Zone 1 and reducing coil water flow to cut pump/chiller power (P_pump ∝ w^3). Keep OA damper at current value to avoid adding hot/humid outdoor load; solve CO2 locally first by rebalancing zone dampers. 4) Control strategy: - Increase Zone 1 damper to deliver more supply (and outdoor-air portion) to that zone. - Slightly trim dampers for Zones 2–4 to keep total airflow roughly constant, limiting fan power and preventing unnecessary cooling. - Reduce coil valve slightly to let zones drift toward 26°C and save pump/chiller power. - Hold fan speed steady to ensure Zone 1 gets a net ventilation boost. - Hold OA damper steady (minimise OA) and rely on redistribution; if Zone 1 CO2 does not drop next interval, consider a small OA increase then. 5) Expected impacts: - Zone 1 CO2: extra local supply should flip its trend from +1 ppm/min to near-flat or slightly negative over 5 minutes, bringing it back to ≲1000 ppm. - Temperatures: coil reduction counteracts any extra cooling from Zone 1’s higher airflow; Zones 2–4 may warm slightly toward 26°C, staying well within 25–27°C. - Power: fan unchanged (avoid cubic penalty); coil_valve 0.58→0.54 reduces pump/chiller power roughly by (0.58^3 - 0.54^3) ≈ 0.195 - 0.157 ≈ 0.038 in relative units (~19% drop of the pump term), while OA is held constant to avoid added cooling/dehumidification load. 6) Smoothness and bounds: All moves are small/moderate relative to previous values and within actuator limits. 7) Contingency for next step: If Zone 1 CO2 remains >1000 ppm, increment OA damper slightly (e.g., +0.02–0.04) or nudge fan +0.01–0.02, but only if redistribution proves insufficient.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.92, 0.64, 0.5, 0.46], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.54, ""fan_speed"": 0.58}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of reasoning:
- Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Zones 1 and 2 are slightly cool and drifting cooler; Zones 3 and 4 are on target with flat trends. A slight warm-up is acceptable to center near 26°C.
- CO2: Zone 1 is at 1000 ppm and rising; Zone 3 is at 981 ppm and rising faster. To avoid exceeding the 1000-ppm target (and stay well below the 1050-ppm hard cap), increase outdoor air (OA) and direct more supply to the higher-CO2 zones. 
- Energy: Prefer OA increase over fan-speed increases to limit cubic fan power growth; accept a moderate OA step to meet IAQ. Keep fan speed steady; use zone damper rebalancing to allocate ventilation where needed. Keep coil close to prior value; increased OA raises mixed-air temp so coil need not be reduced; maintaining coil avoids overheating while still allowing a slight warm-up toward 26°C.
- Smoothness: Changes are moderate except OA (safety-driven to avoid CO2 violation). Dampers adjusted modestly to redistribute airflow.
- Expected effects next 5 min: Higher OA fraction plus slightly more flow to Zones 1 and 3 should arrest and begin reducing CO2 there; temperatures should stay within band and drift toward 26°C.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.94, 0.62, 0.6, 0.35], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.46, ""fan_speed"": 0.58}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

To avoid breaching 1000, do not reduce overall ventilation (fan speed or OA fraction) and avoid cutting dampers in those zones. 3) Energy strategy: With low cooling demand, reduce water-side first (cheaper than fan) to trim pump/chiller load and gently warm supply air, nudging temperatures toward 26°C without hurting CO2. 4) Airflow distribution: Keep dampers for Zones 1–3 unchanged to maintain ventilation; slightly trim Zone 4 (low CO2, at setpoint) to reduce unnecessary flow while preserving comfort. 5) OA and fan: Hold OA damper and fan speed steady to protect CO2 margins, given outdoor air is hot/humid and zones are near 1000 ppm. 6) Smoothness/bounds: Small adjustments only (coil -0.04, Z4 damper -0.05); all commands within bounds.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone 1 is coolest (25.0°C) with a slight downward trend that could dip below 25°C if unchanged; Zones 2–3 are slightly below 26°C and flat; Zone 4 is at 26.0°C with a slight increase.

    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1 – Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C. Zone 1 is cool at 25.0°C (stable), Zone 2 is 25.7°C (slightly warm trend), Zone 3 is 25.9°C (stable), Zone 4 is 26.1°C (warming slightly). Aim to drift Zone 1 up toward 26°C and prevent Zone 4 from warming. Step 2 – CO2/ventilation: Zones 1 (997 ppm) and 3 (994 ppm) are close to the 1000 ppm limit; trends are flat, Zone 2 and 4 trends are modest (+0.4 ppm/min). To avoid any risk of exceeding 1000 ppm, keep outdoor-air and fan speed steady to maintain OA CFM; do not reduce OA or fan speed this interval. Step 3 – Power trade-offs: Prefer water-side adjustments over fan changes (cubic power). Avoid increasing fan speed. Reduce coil slightly to save pump/chiller power and allow the cool zones to drift toward 26°C; compensate Zone 4 via damper rather than fan. Step 4 – Damper strategy: Keep Zone 1 and 3 dampers unchanged to preserve their CO2 dilution; keep Zone 2 damper unchanged (near target). Open Zone 4 damper moderately to arrest warming using redistributed airflow. Step 5 – Setpoints chosen: Keep fan_speed and oa_damper unchanged to protect CO2. Slightly decrease coil_valve (0.24→0.23) to reduce power while maintaining comfort; increase Zone 4 damper (0.30→0.40).

    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone 4 is slightly warm (26.3°C, drifting up). Zones 1–3 are at/just below target (25.1–26.0°C) and drifting slowly up, which is acceptable.
- CO2/ventilation: Zones 1–3 are near the 1000 ppm target (991–999 ppm) with a slight upward trend at current airflow/OA fraction. To avoid exceeding 1000 while minimizing OA intake, do not reduce OA or airflow to those zones. Prefer increasing total dilution slightly without raising OA fraction.
- Energy trade-offs: Fan and pump power scale cubically. Use only a small fan increase to improve ventilation/dilution and to support Zone 4 airflow; keep OA fraction unchanged to avoid added latent/sensible load from hot/humid outdoor air. Keep coil roughly steady to avoid overcooling cooler zones; use zone damper to redistribute more flow to Zone 4. Changes are small to avoid oscillations.
- Actions chosen: (1) Open Zone 4 damper moderately to boost local cooling; keep other dampers steady to protect CO2 in Zones 1–3. (2) Slightly increase fan speed to raise total airflow and absolute OA delivery at the same OA fraction, stabilizing CO2 below 1000 ppm. (3) Hold OA damper at current value to minimize OA intake. (4) Keep coil valve unchanged to avoid increasing central cooling load and potential overcooling; rely on redistribution and slight airflow increase.
- Expected outcome next 5 minutes: Zone 4 temp drift slows or nudges toward 26°C; Zones 1–3 stay near 26°C without overcooling. CO2 in Zones 1–3 stabilizes at or just under 1000 ppm.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

CO2 is low (538–638 ppm) but rising ~9–11 ppm/min. OA is hot and humid (31°C, high AH), so extra OA would increase cooling/latent load. 2) Forecast with previous action: With coil at 1.0 and fan at 1.1, cooling rates are ~0.07–0.09°C/min; over 5 min, zones would still be ~27.3–27.95°C, not yet in band. 3) Control priorities: a) Keep OA at minimum to reduce chiller/latent load and CO2 is far from limits. b) Water-side is already maxed (coil_valve=1.0); since pump-side is typically more efficient than fan, do not reduce coil. c) Increase fan speed moderately (cubic power penalty) to accelerate pull-down, avoiding excessive jumps to limit energy and oscillations. d) Use damper bias to redistribute flow toward the hottest zones while keeping at least one damper fully open to honor static-pressure reset logic. 4) Selected adjustments: - Fan_speed to 1.30 (from 1.10): increases sensible capacity via airflow with a moderate power increase; avoids maxing out at 1.40. - Keep coil_valve at 1.00 to maximize efficient water-side cooling. - Keep OA_damper at 0.05 (minimum) since CO2 remains well below 1000 ppm. - Zone dampers: keep Z1 and Z4 at 1.00 (hottest zones, ensures at least one fully open), trim Z2 and Z3 to 0.85 to nudge more flow to Z1/Z4 without heavy throttling. 5) Expected 5-min effect: Additional airflow plus redistribution should improve cooling rates in Z1/Z4, likely bringing Z2/Z3 closer to ~27.1–27.3°C and Z1/Z4 to ~27.7–27.9°C. CO2 remains safely <750 ppm.

OA is hot and humid (31°C, high AH), so extra OA would increase cooling/latent load. 2) Forecast with previous action: With coil at 1.0 and fan at 1.1, cooling rates are ~0.07–0.09°C/min; over 5 min, zones would still be ~27.3–27.95°C, not yet in band. 3) Control priorities: a) Keep OA at minimum to reduce chiller/latent load and CO2 is far from limits. b) Water-side is already maxed (coil_valve=1.0); since pump-side is typically more efficient than fan, do not reduce coil. c) Increase fan speed moderately (cubic power penalty) to accelerate pull-down, avoiding excessive jumps to limit energy and oscillations. d) Use damper bias to redistribute flow toward the hottest zones while keeping at least one damper fully open to honor static-pressure reset logic. 4) Selected adjustments: - Fan_speed to 1.30 (from 1.10): increases sensible capacity via airflow with a moderate power increase; avoids maxing out at 1.40. - Keep coil_valve at 1.00 to maximize efficient water-side cooling. - Keep OA_damper at 0.05 (minimum) since CO2 remains well below 1000 ppm. - Zone dampers: keep Z1 and Z4 at 1.00 (hottest zones, ensures at least one fully open), trim Z2 and Z3 to 0.85 to nudge more flow to Z1/Z4 without heavy throttling. 5) Expected 5-min effect: Additional airflow plus redistribution should improve cooling rates in Z1/Z4, likely bringing Z2/Z3 closer to ~27.1–27.3°C and Z1/Z4 to ~27.7–27.9°C. CO2 remains safely <750 ppm.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of considerations and decisions:

- CO2 status and forecast with current OA (min 5%): Z1 930 ppm with ~+50 ppm/5 min trend, others lower. All remain <1000 ppm over next interval. Keep OA at minimum to reduce latent/sensible load and chiller energy.
- Energy strategy: Minimize fan power (cubic with speed). Keep zone dampers fully open to minimize static pressure losses (at least one at 100% open; here all). Use modest fan speed reduction for savings while holding coil position to maintain sensible capacity for the warmer zones. Avoid oscillations with small setpoint changes.
- Damper strategy: Keep all zones at 1.0 to preserve static pressure reset benefits and avoid throttling losses; rely on small fan adjustment to nudge all zones toward 26°C. Z2 slightly cool will benefit from slightly reduced airflow; Z1/Z4 still within band and trending down.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state vs. targets:
- Comfort: All zones within 25–27°C. Z1=26.5 (slightly high), Z2=25.7 (slightly low and cooling fastest), Z3=26.1, Z4=26.6 (high). All are trending slightly cooler; a mild reduction in net cooling is desirable to steer toward 26.0°C.
- CO2: Z1=979 ppm rising at ~+9.5 ppm/min. At current OA=0.05, 5-min projection ≈ 979 + 9.5*5 ≈ 1026 ppm (>1000 target, risk to climb). Other zones remain <1000 with comfortable margins.
- Energy priorities: Fan and pump power scale ~cube. Prefer water-side (coil_valve) adjustments first; avoid large fan increases. Minimise OA except as needed to keep CO2 ≤ 1000.

2) CO2 control strategy (minimise OA while preventing Z1 >1000):
- We need more ventilation specifically benefiting Z1. Increase OA fraction moderately and bias airflow toward Z1 by trimming the coolest zone’s damper (Z2). Keep at least one damper 100% open for static-pressure reset (Z1 stays at 1.0).
- Doubling OA from 0.05→0.10 roughly halves Z1’s CO2 rise; adding a slight reallocation to Z1 further reduces it. To gain margin under 1000 without overshooting OA, set OA≈0.12 and slightly reduce Z2 damper; keep fan near current to maintain ventilation effectiveness.

3) Comfort and energy balancing:
- Reduce coil_valve slightly to cut pump/chiller load and to ease overcooling (Z2 is already cool). This also offsets extra OA heat load.
- With most dampers wide open, we can nudge fan down a bit to save power while relying on the higher OA fraction to maintain ventilation; keep change small to avoid oscillations.

4) Predicted outcomes over next 5 min:
- CO2 (Z1): OA 0.12 (~2.4× OA fraction) plus modest reallocation from trimming Z2 should reduce Z1’s CO2 rise to ≈ +3–4 ppm/min → final ≈ 995–999 ppm (≤1000 target). Other zones improve further.
- Temperatures: Slightly less cooling from lower coil_valve, slightly lower fan, and warmer mixed air from more OA will flatten or modestly reverse the cooling trend. All zones should remain within 25–27°C and drift toward 26°C.
- Energy: Fan 0.64→0.62 saves ~9% fan power (0.64^3→0.62^3). Coil 0.84→0.80 saves ~13–14% pump power (0.84^3→0.80^3). OA increase raises chiller load, but net cooling reduction helps counterbalance.

5) Actuator choices (smooth, within bounds, with at least one damper at 100%):
- Zone dampers: keep Z1=1.0 (priority and static reset), Z2=0.90 (coolest zone, reduce overcooling and reallocate air), Z3=1.0, Z4=1.0.
- OA damper: 0.12 to prevent Z1 CO2 from exceeding 1000 while remaining as low as practical.
- Coil valve: 0.80 to reduce pump/chiller power and temper overcooling.
- Fan speed: 0.62 for modest fan power savings while maintaining adequate ventilation with higher OA.

6) Next-step guardrails:
- If Z1 CO2 still trends to ≥1000 next interval, increment OA to ~0.14 or slightly increase fan (e.g., +0.01–0.02) before touching additional dampers. If temps warm too much, restore coil_valve by +0.02.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.9, 1.0, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.12, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.62}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort vs. target 26C: Z1=26.5 (slightly high, cooling), Z2=25.6 (slightly low, cooling), Z3=26.0 (on target, slight cooling), Z4=26.6 (slightly high, cooling). Forecast 5 min with current trends: Z1≈26.45, Z2≈25.50, Z3≈25.95, Z4≈26.55 — all within 25–27C, but Z2 is drifting below target; Z1 and Z4 need sustained cooling. 2) CO2: Z1=1016 ppm rising +7.1 ppm/min → ~1051 ppm in 5 min (breach of 1050 limit). Others (849–914 ppm) remain <1000 with current trends. Primary constraint: lower Z1 CO2 trajectory immediately. 3) Energy strategy: Increasing coil (water side) is cheaper than fan for thermal load; however, CO2 requires increased ventilation (OA mass flow) achieved by either higher OA fraction or higher total supply flow. Given hot/humid OA, we minimize total OA increase and avoid large fan increases (fan power ~ f^3). Prefer: modest OA fraction increase plus airflow redistribution toward Z1 by throttling cooler zones.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort check: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1=26.4 (slightly warm, cooling slowly), Z2=25.5 (slightly cool and cooling), Z3=26.0 (on setpoint, slight cooling), Z4=26.5 (slightly warm, cooling). Aim to nudge Z2/Z3 cooling down and keep Z1/Z4 near 26°C. 2) CO2 risk: Z1=1045 ppm rising +5.6 ppm/min → projected ~1073 ppm in 5 min, exceeding 1050 limit. Others (Z2=873, Z3=942, Z4=894) are safe for now. We must immediately increase ventilation to Z1. 3) Energy/strategy trade-offs: Fan power scales ~f^3; pump (coil valve proxy) scales ~w^3 and is typically cheaper per delivered load. For CO2 control, we need more outdoor air (OA) cfm to Z1. Options: (a) raise OA fraction, (b) raise fan, (c) redistribute zone dampers to favor Z1. To minimize power, first increase OA fraction modestly and redistribute dampers, while avoiding a fan increase (which is cubic). 4) OA adjustment: Increase OA damper from 0.15 to 0.22 (+47% OA fraction). At the same fan speed this yields ~47% more OA cfm systemwide; with damper bias, Z1 should get a larger share, reversing its CO2 rise below the 1050 ppm limit. 5) Zone damper redistribution and static-pressure rule: Keep Z1 at 1.0 to be the ‘wide-open’ zone for static pressure reset. Throttle Z2 (cooling too much) and Z4 slightly to shift flow toward Z1. Keep Z3 near previous to avoid worsening its CO2 (which is trending up). Result: Z1=1.0, Z2=0.60, Z3=0.90, Z4=0.85. This should raise Z1’s supply (and OA) while reducing unnecessary cooling and ventilation in Z2/Z4. 6) Fan speed: Hold at 0.62 to avoid cubic power increase; OA increase and damper bias should be sufficient to stop Z1’s CO2 climb. If Z1 CO2 does not decline next interval, the next step would be a small fan increase or a slight further OA increase. 7) Coil valve: Slightly increase to 0.88 to handle added sensible/latent load from hotter, more humid OA while keeping zone temps near 26°C. Using water-side capacity is typically cheaper than increasing fan for the same thermal effect. 8) Smoothness/constraints: All changes are within bounds and moderate. Once Z1 CO2 is back <1000 and trending down, we will trim OA toward minimum again to reduce coil/chiller power.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.6, 0.9, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.22, ""coil_valve"": 0.88, ""fan_speed"": 0.62}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Identify urgent constraints. Zone 1 CO2 = 1079 ppm exceeds the hard limit (1050 ppm). Immediate ventilation increase is required to bring it down quickly. Temperatures: Z1=26.5, Z4=26.6 (slightly warm), Z2=25.5 (slightly cool), Z3=26.0 (on target). Comfort band 25–27°C is currently met but Z1/Z4 need a small cooling push.
Step 2: Control strategy priorities. For CO2, only outdoor air fraction and airflow matter; coil valve cannot reduce CO2. For temperature, prefer increasing water flow (coil_valve) over fan because pump power is typically cheaper than fan for the same load. Keep at least one zone damper fully open for static-pressure reset to minimize fan power.
Step 3: Zone damper adjustments. Keep Zone 1 damper at 1.0 (fully open) to maximize airflow and satisfy static-pressure reset. Reduce Zone 2 damper (it’s a bit cool) to cut unnecessary flow/power and avoid overcooling. Keep Zone 3 relatively open due to CO2=973 ppm trending up. Slightly increase Zone 4 damper to improve cooling and ventilation since it’s warm.
Step 4: Outdoor air and fan. Raise OA damper substantially (from 0.22 to 0.50) to quickly dilute high CO2 in Zone 1 and stabilize Zone 3. Increase fan speed moderately (0.62→0.70) to boost zone ventilation rates without incurring the steep cubic penalty of a large increase. This combination provides a strong but controlled CO2 reduction while avoiding excessive oscillation.
Step 5: Coil valve (cooling capacity). Increase coil valve moderately high (0.88→0.95) to offset the warmer, more humid mixed air from higher OA, helping pull Z1 and Z4 toward 26°C while avoiding over-reliance on fan speed. Z2 damper reduction helps prevent overcooling there.
Step 6: Power trade-off check (qualitative). Fan power scales with f^3: 0.62^3≈0.24 → 0.70^3≈0.34 (≈+44%). Pump power scales with w^3: 0.88^3≈0.68 → 0.95^3≈0.86 (≈+26%). The increases are justified short-term to correct the CO2 violation; once CO2 drops <1000 ppm, we can ratchet OA and fan back down.
Step 7: Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes. Z1 CO2 should trend downward substantially due to higher OA fraction and strong Z1 airflow; Z3 CO2 should stabilize or decrease. Temperatures: Z1/Z4 should drift toward 26°C; Z2 should remain within band due to reduced damper; Z3 should hold near 26°C.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1=26.4 (slightly warm, flat trend), Z2=25.6 (slightly cool, slight warming), Z3=25.9 (near target, slight cooling), Z4=26.5 (slightly warm, slight cooling). Aim to nudge Z1/Z4 down and let Z2/Z3 drift toward 26 without overshooting.
2) CO2/ventilation: Z1=1049 ppm with a decreasing trend (-5.4 ppm/min). Others are ≤ 956 ppm and stable/decreasing. Because Z1 is near the limit, do not reduce outdoor air or ventilation to Z1 this interval; maintain or slightly bias more airflow to Z1.
3) Power strategy: Fan and pump power scale cubically; prefer water-side (coil_valve) adjustments over fan for small changes. However, coil valve already high (0.95); we’ll avoid increasing it unless needed. Keep OA at current minimum that satisfies CO2; avoid increases due to hot/humid OA. Minimize throttling by keeping at least one damper at 100% open.
4) Damper adjustments: Keep Z1 at 1.0 (critical for both temp and CO2). Open Z4 from 0.95→1.0 to aid cooling and reduce throttling. Slightly reduce Z2 from 0.45→0.40 and Z3 from 0.90→0.85 to lessen cooling to cooler zones and bias more flow to Z1/Z4 while changes remain smooth.
5) OA damper: Hold at 0.50. Z1 CO2 is dropping at current OA; reducing OA risks exceeding 1050 ppm; increasing OA would raise coil/chiller load unnecessarily.
6) Coil and fan: Keep coil_valve at 0.95 (already high; adequate cooling). Keep fan_speed at 0.70 to preserve Z1 ventilation; a reduction would yield marginal power savings but risks weakening the CO2 downward trend when Z1 is at the limit.
7) Expected outcome over next 5 minutes: Z1 receives slightly more airflow, aiding a small temp drop toward 26 and sustaining CO2 decrease. Z4 cools toward 26 with damper at 1.0. Z2 and Z3 warm slightly toward 26 due to reduced flow. All zones remain within 25–27°C. OA minimized subject to CO2 constraint. At least two dampers at 100% supports lower required static pressure. If next interval Z1 CO2 < 1000 ppm with a negative trend, consider a small OA reduction and/or fan trim for power savings.
8) Smoothness and bounds: All changes are small (≤0.05 step on zone dampers); OA, coil, and fan unchanged, respecting bounds.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.4, 0.85, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.5, ""coil_valve"": 0.95, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

- Temps: Z1 26.4 (slightly warm), Z2 25.6 (slightly cool), Z3 25.9 (near target), Z4 26.5 (warm). Aim to cool Z1/Z4 a bit, avoid overcooling Z2.
- CO2: Z1 1024 ppm decreasing; must ensure ≤1000 within next 5 minutes without exceeding 1050. Others are safe.

Step 2: Ventilation/CO2 strategy with minimal energy.
- Raise OA fraction just enough to bring Z1 under 1000 ppm within 5 min. Increasing OA from 0.50 to 0.58 (≈+16%) should increase the CO2 decay rate from ~-4.5 to about -5.2 ppm/min, yielding ~998 ppm after 5 min, giving a small buffer while keeping OA near-minimum.
- Keep fan speed unchanged to avoid cubic power penalty; use OA fraction and damper distribution to solve CO2.

Step 3: Cooling/energy trade-off.
- Prefer water-side (coil valve) before fan due to cubic power. Increase coil_valve from 0.95 to 1.00 to provide a bit more cooling capacity and offset added OA load; keep fan_speed at 0.70 to minimize fan power.

Step 4: Zone damper distribution and static-pressure logic.
- Keep at least one zone damper at 100% open to minimize throttling; maintain Z1 and Z4 at 1.00 (both warm and Z1 has higher CO2).
- Slightly close Z2 (cool) from 0.40 to 0.35 to reduce overcooling and flow, and nudge Z3 from 0.85 to 0.80 to bias available cooling toward warmer zones. These are smooth adjustments (≤0.05 change) to avoid oscillations.

Step 5: Expected outcomes next interval.
- Z1 CO2 falls below 1000 ppm; other zones remain safe.
- Z1/Z4 temperatures trend toward 26°C with increased coil capacity; Z2 avoids further cooling due to reduced damper.
- Power minimized by avoiding fan increase, using small OA increase and coil valve at 1.0. All actuators within bounds.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.35, 0.8, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.58, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort check: Z1=26.4C (+0.4), Z2=25.7C (-0.3), Z3=25.9C (-0.1), Z4=26.5C (+0.5). All within 25–27C but Z1/Z4 are slightly warm and flat (~0 C/min). 2) CO2 check: Z1=990 ppm (worst-case), trending -6.1 ppm/min with OA=0.58 and fan=0.7; others 825–919 ppm, all falling. CO2 must stay ≤1000 ppm (never >1050). 3) Energy/physics: Coil valve already at 1.0 (max water-side). Water-side is cheaper than fan, but we’re at max, so next levers are OA fraction, zone dampers, then small fan tweaks. Reducing OA when it’s hot outside lowers mixed-air temperature load at the coil, improving supply-air temperature and cutting chiller energy, without paying cubic fan power. 4) OA strategy: Step OA down modestly (avoid oscillation and protect CO2). From 0.58 → 0.48 is a ~17% reduction. Approximate Z1 CO2 trend scales with OA; -6.1*(0.48/0.58) ≈ -5.0 ppm/min → about -25 ppm over 5 min; Z1 should drop to ~965 ppm, maintaining margin below 1000. If trends remain favorable next interval, we can step OA down further. 5) Air distribution: Keep at least one damper 100% open for static-pressure reset; prioritize flow to warm zones. Hold Z1=100% and Z4=100%. Throttle cooler zones slightly: Z2 from 0.35→0.25 (it’s 25.7C and slightly warming), Z3 from 0.8→0.75 (near setpoint). This redirects available cold air to Z1/Z4. 6) Fan: To minimize energy, avoid fan increases (cubic penalty). With OA reduced, supply air should get colder; combined with damper prioritization, Z1/Z4 should begin to cool without raising fan. Keep fan at 0.7 (smooth, stable). 7) Coil valve: Remain at 1.0 (max cooling), plan to back off once Z1/Z4 errors shrink and OA can be trimmed further. 8) Safety: Changes are within bounds and smooth. Expect Z1/Z4 to move toward 26C; CO2 stays safely below 1000 ppm with OA=0.48. Reassess next interval and, if CO2 remains <980 ppm, reduce OA further to save energy.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.25, 0.75, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.48, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1 – Read conditions: Z1=26.4C (slightly warm, drifting down), Z4=26.4C (slightly warm, drifting down), Z2=25.9C (near setpoint, drifting up), Z3=25.9C (near setpoint, flat). CO2: Z1=976 ppm (falling), Z2=921 ppm (rising), Z3=912 ppm (falling), Z4=813 ppm (falling). OA damper currently high (0.48) with outdoor 33.3C and humid, adding load. Coil is maxed (1.0). Fan is moderate (0.7).
Step 2 – Ventilation/CO2 strategy: Minimise OA while keeping CO2 ≤1000 ppm and never >1050 ppm. With current levels and 5-minute horizon, reducing OA substantially remains safe. Choose OA=0.10 (from 0.48) to cut load/chiller energy while keeping a safety margin: even if worst-affected zone CO2 rate increases to ~+4–5 ppm/min after OA cut, Z1 would reach ~996–1001 ppm in 5 minutes (still ≤1000 or just at), and far below 1050.
Step 3 – Cooling/power trade-off: Lower OA reduces mixed-air temperature and coil load. With coil at 1.0 it could overcool; pump power is cubic in valve, so reduce coil first. Set coil_valve=0.90 (from 1.0) for ~27% pump power reduction while maintaining capacity. Keep fan at 0.70 this interval to avoid simultaneous large changes in two energy paths and to maintain stable ventilation distribution.
Step 4 – Zone airflow (static-pressure reset): Keep at least one damper fully open to lower static pressure requirement. Keep Z1 and Z4 at 1.0. Slightly increase Z2 damper to 0.30 to arrest its warming trend and help its CO2 after OA reduction. Trim Z3 damper to 0.60 (from 0.75) to reduce unnecessary flow while staying near 26C. This keeps two dampers at 100%, allowing low static pressure and low fan power.
Step 5 – Comfort/CO2 check: Expected effect over next 5 min: Z1/Z4 should drift toward 26C without overshoot due to coil reduction; Z2 should hold near 26C; Z3 may inch toward 26C. CO2 should remain <1000 ppm in all zones with OA=0.10; none will approach 1050. If next interval shows Z1/Z4 cooling too fast, we can either further reduce coil or trim fan slightly; if CO2 rises faster than expected in Z1 or Z2, nudge OA to ~0.12–0.15.
Step 6 – Energy summary: Major savings from OA reduction (less chiller load) and pump power drop (0.90^3≈0.729 vs 1.0). Fan held at 0.70 for stability; static reset preserved with two wide-open dampers.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.1, ""coil_valve"": 0.9, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Actions: increase OA damper to 0.24 (from 0.10) to boost ventilation; keep Z1 damper at 1.0, open Z3 more (0.8) and slightly open Z2 (0.4) to mitigate their CO2 trends; trim Z4 (0.7) since it has low CO2 and to reduce unnecessary cooling/vent; hold fan at 0.7 to avoid cubic power penalty; increase coil valve to 0.97 to handle added OA load and keep temps near 26°C. Expected outcome (next 5 min): Z1 CO2 trend turns down or near flat, staying well below 1050; Z2–Z4 remain ≤1000; temperatures remain within 25–27°C and closer to 26°C; power is minimised by avoiding a fan increase and using coil water preferentially."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Priorities this interval: Zone 1 CO2 is 1056 ppm (>1050 hard limit) and rising; must immediately increase ventilation to drive it down. Zones 2 and 3 are near 1000 ppm and rising; need enough fresh air to keep them ≤1000. Temperatures are all within 25–27°C; Zones 1 and 4 are slightly warm, Zone 3 slightly cool. 2) Energy/physics strategy: Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.5°C), so we keep OA as low as possible while still correcting CO2. Fan power scales cubically, so avoid large fan increases. Coil valve (water flow) is already high (0.97); keep it steady to maintain supply temperature against warmer mixed air from higher OA. Keep at least one zone damper at 100% (Zone 1) to minimize static pressure and throttling losses. 3) Ventilation adjustments: Increase OA damper moderately (0.24→0.36, +50% OA fraction) and slightly increase fan speed (0.70→0.76, +8.6% flow). Combined, fresh air delivered scales roughly by 1.5×1.086≈1.63, providing a strong dilution boost. 4) Zone airflow distribution: Keep Zone 1 damper at 1.0 to maximize flushing. Maintain Zone 2 at 0.4 to avoid overcooling while benefiting from higher OA and fan. Set Zone 3 damper to 0.7 (down slightly from 0.8) to temper its mild overcooling yet still increase its fresh-air delivery via higher OA and fan. Keep Zone 4 at 0.7; added airflow plus high coil should cool it toward 26°C. 5) Thermal balance: Coil valve stays at 0.97 to counteract warmer mixed air from higher OA; this avoids a supply temperature rise that could worsen comfort. Fan increase is modest (cubic penalty limited), while OA lift is the minimum judged to promptly pull Zone 1 CO2 below 1050 and trend all zones ≤1000. 6) Expected outcomes in 5–10 minutes: Zone 1 CO2 reverses and drops below 1050 quickly, trending toward ≤1000. Zones 2 and 3 stabilize under 1000. Temps remain within 25–27°C, nudging toward 26°C, with Zone 3 avoiding further overcooling.

- Z1: 26.2°C (+0.2 above target), cooling slowly (-0.01°C/min). Fine, trending toward 26°C.
- Z2: 26.0°C (on target), stable.
- Z3: 25.8°C (-0.2 below target), cooling slightly; better to ease its airflow to drift up toward 26°C.
- Z4: 26.4°C (+0.4), essentially flat; needs a bit more airflow/cooling.
2) CO2/ventilation:
- Z1: 1047 ppm and decreasing (-1.7 ppm/min). This is above the 1000 ppm goal and close to the 1050 ppm hard limit; we should increase dilution to pull it down faster and create safety margin against any occupancy uptick.
- Z2: 977 ppm, slight rise; still safe.
- Z3: 979 ppm, slight rise; safe.
- Z4: 892 ppm, stable; safe.
Given OA air is hot, increase outdoor air only as much as needed for Z1. A modest bump in OA fraction improves dilution while limiting chiller load. Keep at least one zone damper fully open (Z1) to minimize throttling.
3) Energy trade-offs and actuator strategy:
- Use water-side first (coil_valve) since it’s generally cheaper than fan for the same load. We’re already high (0.97); nudge to 1.00 to offset any extra OA heat.
- Keep fan roughly steady to avoid cubic power penalty and to preserve ventilation rate. Avoid reducing fan right now to ensure Z1 CO2 keeps dropping.
- Reallocate airflow: keep Z1 at 100% open; increase Z4 damper to boost its cooling; slightly reduce Z3 (a bit cool) to reduce unnecessary cooling; keep Z2 unchanged to avoid worsening its CO2 trend. This also maintains the static-pressure reset logic (one damper at 100%).
4) Proposed setpoints and expected effects (next ~5 min):
- OA damper from 0.36 -> 0.43: increases dilution; Z1 CO2 should drop faster, improving margin below 1050 and moving toward ≤1000. Other zones remain safe.
- Coil valve 0.97 -> 1.00: offsets warmer OA, maintaining supply air temperature and supporting Z4 cooling.
- Fan speed hold at 0.76: avoids fan power increase; ventilation remains sufficient.
- Zone dampers: Z4 + airflow to cool from 26.4°C toward 26°C; Z3 - airflow to drift up toward 26°C; Z2 unchanged; Z1 remains wide open.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Assess current state vs. constraints.
- All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. Z1 26.1 (slight cooling), Z2 26.2 (slight warming), Z3 25.9 (slight warming), Z4 26.3 (slight cooling).
- CO2: Z1 is the tightest at 994 ppm and currently decreasing (~-2.6 ppm/min). Others are ≤ 967 ppm and decreasing. OA intake is relatively high at 0.43 while outdoor air is hot (34°C), adding load.

Step 2: Strategy to minimize power while maintaining comfort and CO2.
- Reduce outdoor air toward the minimum necessary to keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never >1050). Do this smoothly to avoid reversals.
- Favor coil (water-side) adjustments over fan increases when seeking more cooling; for energy minimization now, trim both OA and total airflow slightly, and back off coil modestly since zones are near setpoint.
- Maintain at least one damper 100% open for static-pressure reset; open warmer zones slightly to reduce throttling and avoid needing higher fan pressure.

Step 3: Compute cautious adjustments.
- OA damper: 0.43 → 0.36 (≈-16% OA fraction). With fan near current, absolute OA flow drops ~16–18%. For Z1 starting at 994 ppm, even if the CO2 trend softened from -2.6 ppm/min to about 0 to +1 ppm/min, 5-minute rise would be ≤ +5 ppm, staying ≤ 999 ppm (well under 1000 and far below 1050).
- Fan speed: 0.76 → 0.74 (small, smooth decrease). Fan power reduces by ~7–8% (0.76^3 ≈ 0.439, 0.74^3 ≈ 0.405). This should still keep temperatures stable given modest damper adjustments and reduced OA load.
- Coil valve: 1.00 → 0.96 to trim pump energy (~11.5% pump power reduction) while keeping sufficient cooling capacity since zones are near target and OA load is reduced.
- Zone dampers: Keep Z1 at 1.00 (ensures at least one fully open). Open Z2 from 0.35 → 0.48 to address its slight warming and reduce throttling. Keep Z3 at 0.50. Keep Z4 at 0.92 (already slightly high and trending down; avoid overcooling by not opening further).

Step 4: Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes.
- Temperatures: Z1 ~26.1→~26.1–26.13; Z2 ~26.2→~26.16–26.20; Z3 ~25.9→~25.95–26.0; Z4 ~26.3→~26.27–26.30. All remain within 25–27°C and near 26°C.
- CO2: Z1 ~994→~995–999 ppm; others remain well below 1000 ppm. No risk of exceeding 1050 ppm.

Step 5: Constraints and smoothness check.
- Bounds respected for all actuators.
- At least one damper at 1.0 (Z1) to support lower static pressure.
- Changes are moderate to avoid oscillations. If CO2 in Z1 rises or temperature drifts warm, next step will prioritize a slight OA increase before increasing fan; if cooling is excessive, back off coil further first.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.48, 0.5, 0.92], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 0.96, ""fan_speed"": 0.74}","{

This should still keep temperatures stable given modest damper adjustments and reduced OA load.\n- Coil valve: 1.00 → 0.96 to trim pump energy (~11.5% pump power reduction) while keeping sufficient cooling capacity since zones are near target and OA load is reduced.\n- Zone dampers: Keep Z1 at 1.00 (ensures at least one fully open). Open Z2 from 0.35 → 0.48 to address its slight warming and reduce throttling. Keep Z3 at 0.50. Keep Z4 at 0.92 (already slightly high and trending down; avoid overcooling by not opening further).\n\nStep 4: Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes.\n- Temperatures: Z1 ~26.1→~26.1–26.13; Z2 ~26.2→~26.16–26.20; Z3 ~25.9→~25.95–26.0; Z4 ~26.3→~26.27–26.30. All remain within 25–27°C and near 26°C.\n- CO2: Z1 ~994→~995–999 ppm; others remain well below 1000 ppm. No risk of exceeding 1050 ppm.\n\nStep 5: Constraints and smoothness check.\n- Bounds respected for all actuators.\n- At least one damper at 1.0 (Z1) to support lower static pressure.\n- Changes are moderate to avoid oscillations. If CO2 in Z1 rises or temperature drifts warm, next step will prioritize a slight OA increase before increasing fan; if cooling is excessive, back off coil further first."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess constraints and trends: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. Z1 CO2 = 1002 ppm (>1000 target) and rising (+1.3 ppm/min); Z3 CO2 = 976 ppm and rising (+1.6 ppm/min). Z2 CO2 is decreasing; Z4 is low. Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.3°C, high AH), so extra OA increases coil/chiller load; keep OA minimal while achieving CO2 control. 2) Control priorities: Prevent CO2 violations while preserving comfort and minimizing power. Since water-side changes don’t affect CO2, address CO2 by (a) redistributing supply air toward Z1 and Z3, and (b) a minimal OA increase to reverse the upward CO2 trend, avoiding large fan increases (cubic penalty). Maintain at least one damper fully open for static-pressure reset (Z1 at 1.0). 3) Damper strategy: Keep Z1 at 1.0 (anchor). Slightly open Z3 to increase ventilation there. Slightly trim Z2 and Z4 dampers (their CO2 is fine) to bias flow to Z1/Z3 without large throttling. Changes are smooth to avoid oscillation. 4) OA and fan: Apply a small OA damper increase (0.36 → 0.38) to help pull Z1 below 1000 ppm and flatten Z3’s rise, while keeping fan speed unchanged to avoid cubic fan power increase. 5) Coil valve: Keep coil valve high (0.96) this interval to offset the added sensible/latent load from the small OA increase and maintain comfort; consider reduction next interval if temps remain stable. 6) Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes: Z1 CO2 trend should turn negative (targeting <1000 ppm), Z3 CO2 should flatten or slightly decrease; zone temperatures remain within 25–27°C near 26°C.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of reasoning and actions:
1) Comfort/trends: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. Z1=26.0°C (slightly cooling), Z2=26.3°C (slightly warming), Z3=26.1°C (steady), Z4=26.2°C (slightly cooling). Focus is to nudge Z2 cooler without overcooling others.
2) CO2/ventilation: Highest CO2 is Z3=991 ppm with a +0.8 ppm/min trend; over 5 minutes this would be ~+4 ppm (~995 ppm) at current OA=0.38. To minimize OA while staying under 1000 ppm, make a small OA reduction only (to 0.36). This should keep all zones <1000 ppm with margin, while reducing latent/sensible load from hot, humid OA.
3) Energy strategy: Avoid increasing fan due to cubic power penalty. Coil valve is already high (0.96), so keep it steady and use damper redistribution to address Z2 warmth. Keep at least one damper fully open to reduce static-pressure requirement (Z1 stays at 1.0).
4) Damper adjustments: Open Z2 damper (0.55→0.70) to deliver more cooling to the slightly warm zone. Slightly trim Z3 and Z4 (0.85→0.80) since they are near/above setpoint and not warming, limiting total airflow increase. Keep Z1 at 1.0 to satisfy static-pressure reset logic.
5) Fan/coil: Hold fan at 0.72 to avoid loss of capacity while redistributing air; keep coil valve at 0.96 to maintain cooling without pushing pump power further. Changes are smooth/modest to avoid oscillations.
6) Expected outcome next 5 min: Z2 warming trend should neutralize or begin cooling toward ~26.1–26.3°C; Z1 may drift slightly below 26 but remain within band; Z3 and Z4 should remain near 26–26.2°C. CO2 remains below 1000 ppm; OA minimized safely.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.7, 0.8, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 0.96, ""fan_speed"": 0.72}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Small drifts: Z1 slightly cooling (-0.01°C/min), Z3 slightly warming (+0.01°C/min), Z2/Z4 flat. 2) CO2 risk: Z1=998 ppm (+1 ppm/min) and Z3=999 ppm (+1.6 ppm/min). At current settings they would exceed 1000 ppm within 5 min, which violates the ≤1000 ppm goal (while staying <1050 ppm). 3) Energy/ventilation trade-off: Outdoor air is hot/humid (32.9°C, AH 0.0191), so increasing OA fraction significantly raises coil/chiller load. To minimise power, prefer: a) redistribute supply to high-CO2 zones, b) minimal fan increase to raise OA cfm without increasing OA fraction, c) keep water flow high to meet load (pump energy typically cheaper per load than fan and OA latent). 4) Static pressure reset: keep at least one damper fully open to reduce throttling; we will keep two zones at 100% open. 5) Actions chosen: - Zone dampers: keep Z1 at 1.0 (already max) and open Z3 from 0.8→1.0 to boost their ventilation; trim Z2 from 0.7→0.65 and Z4 from 0.8→0.6 to reallocate flow toward Z1/Z3 while maintaining comfort (Z2 slightly warm but still safe; Z4 near 26.1°C). - Fan speed: slight increase 0.72→0.74 to raise total OA cfm by ~2.8% without increasing OA fraction; cubic fan power rises ~8–9%, but avoids large latent/sensible penalty from more OA. This, combined with damper redistribution, should flatten or reverse CO2 rise in Z1/Z3 while keeping Z2/Z4 well below 1000 ppm. - OA damper: hold at 0.36 to avoid extra latent load; adjust only if CO2 still trends upward next interval. - Coil valve: hold at 0.96 (near max) to maintain comfort with rising outdoor temperature; do not reduce cooling yet. 6) Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes: Z1/Z3 CO2 stabilize or dip below 1000 ppm; Z2/Z4 remain comfortably below limits. Temperatures remain inside 25–27°C and near 26°C; Z2 may drift slightly up but should stay <26.6–26.7°C. 7) Smoothness and constraints: All changes are modest, within bounds; at least one (actually two) dampers at 100% to support low static pressure and reduced throttling. Next step if CO2 still climbs: increment fan slightly again or minimally raise OA fraction; if CO2 drops with margin, consider small fan reduction to save power.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.65, 1.0, 0.6], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 0.96, ""fan_speed"": 0.74}","{

- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z2 and Z4 are slightly warm (26.2°C), Z1 is slightly cool (25.9°C), Z3 is on setpoint (26.0°C). Aim to nudge Z2/Z4 down toward 26 while avoiding further cooling of Z1. 2) CO2/ventilation: Z1=999 ppm and Z3=998 ppm are close to the 1000 ppm limit but trending down.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1=25.7 (slightly cool, drifting down), Z2=26.2 (slightly warm, flat), Z3=26.0 (on target, drifting down slightly), Z4=26.3 (slightly warm, drifting up). CO2 is 868–984 ppm and falling in all zones. Outdoor air is hot and humid (32.7°C, high AH), so OA increases sensible and latent load. 2) Ventilation/CO2: Since all CO2 values are <1000 ppm and decreasing, we can reduce OA fraction to cut coil load and chiller energy while keeping CO2 ≤1000. To avoid overshoot, reduce OA moderately (not to minimum) because OA mass flow also scales with fan flow. From 0.45 -> 0.30 (~33% fractional reduction); combined with a small fan reduction this should keep peak CO2 <1000 over 5 minutes. 3) Power trade-off: Use water (coil) preferentially over air (fan) for the same Q because fan power is more expensive (cubic; and guidance favors water). We will lower fan speed more and keep coil relatively high to maintain cooling with lower fan power. Also, reducing OA reduces load, allowing a small coil reduction for pump savings without compromising comfort. 4) Air/water split: Decrease fan from 0.80 to 0.70 (fan power ~0.512→0.343, ~33% saving). Keep coil high but slightly reduce from 1.0 to 0.95 (pump power ~1.0→0.857). Net: bias toward water while leveraging reduced OA load. 5) Zone airflow balancing and static pressure: Keep at least one (preferably more) zone damper at 100% open to minimize throttling and allow lower static/fan. Leave Z1 and Z3 at 1.0. Z2 is slightly warm → open a bit (0.55→0.60). Z4 is slightly warm and rising → open more (0.50→0.70) to prioritize flow there at lower fan speed. 6) Smoothness/limits: Changes are moderate (fan -0.10, coil -0.05, OA -0.15, dampers +0.05 to +0.20). All within bounds. 7) Constraint check: Temperatures should remain in 25–27°C: Z1/Z3 may drift slightly up toward 26 (desirable), Z2 should nudge down toward 26, Z4 opening should counter its slight warming. CO2: OA and fan reductions cut OA mass flow to ~58% of previous; with current negative CO2 trends, 5-minute rise should remain below 1000 ppm and far from 1050 ppm. Humidity load decreases with reduced OA, aiding coil capacity.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.6, 1.0, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.95, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Assess comfort vs. setpoint (26°C, band 25–27°C). Z1=25.7 (slightly cool), Z2=26.3 (slightly warm), Z3=26.0 (on target), Z4=26.3 (slightly warm). All within band; no urgent thermal corrections needed. Trends are mild (~0.01°C/min), so small adjustments are sufficient.
Step 2: Assess CO2 vs. limits. Z1=1017 ppm rising +2.5 ppm/min; Z3=1011 ppm rising +2.1 ppm/min; Z2=998 ppm rising +2.2 ppm/min; Z4=886 ppm. Objective is ≤1000 ppm and must never exceed 1050 ppm. Without action, Z1≈1029.5 and Z3≈1021.5 in 5 min; Z2 would cross 1000. We need a ventilation increase now.
Step 3: Energy/physics trade-offs. Coil_valve already at 1.0 (water-side maxed), so we cannot add cheaper water-side capacity. Outdoor air is very hot/humid (34.5°C, high AH), so increasing OA fraction significantly raises cooling load; fan increase is expensive (cubic) but may be less costly than a large OA rise. Strategy: modest fan increase plus minimal OA fraction increase and smart re-distribution via dampers.
Step 4: Static-pressure logic. Keep at least one damper fully open to minimize throttling. Currently Z1 and Z3 are at 1.0; keep them there to set a low static pressure requirement.
Step 5: Distribution adjustments. Prioritize more supply/ventilation to high-CO2 zones (Z1, Z3). Keep Z1=1.0 and Z3=1.0. Slightly pinch a low-CO2 zone (Z4) from 0.65→0.60 to bias flow to Z1/Z3 without large fan increases. Keep Z2 at 0.55 to avoid worsening its marginal CO2 (998 ppm).
Step 6: Central setpoints for CO2 control with minimal energy. Increase fan_speed 0.70→0.74 (~+6% flow; fan power ~0.70^3=0.343 to 0.74^3≈0.405, ~+18% fan power). Slightly open oa_damper 0.32→0.34 (~+6% OA fraction). Net OA volume increases roughly ~12% (flow×fraction), aiding CO2 reduction while limiting latent/sensible penalty. Keep coil_valve at 1.0 (already max). These are smooth changes to avoid oscillations.
Step 7: Expected outcomes next 5 minutes. Increased OA and redistribution should flatten or reverse CO2 rises in Z1/Z3 and keep Z2 ≤1000 ppm, while Z4 remains low. Temperatures should remain within the 25–27°C band: Z1/Z3 may cool slightly from extra flow, OA increase slightly offsets this; Z2/Z4 may warm slightly from damper bias but remain within band. Monitor CO2 slopes; if any zone remains >1000 ppm with positive slope next interval, increment OA slightly (e.g., +0.02–0.03) before further fan increases to balance energy and comfort.
Step 8: Bounds check and smoothness. All commands within limits and represent small, stable adjustments. Maintain at least one (here two) dampers at 100% open.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.55, 1.0, 0.6], ""oa_damper"": 0.34, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.74}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zones 2 (26.3°C) and 4 (26.4°C) are slightly warm; Zone 1 (25.7°C) is a bit cool; Zone 3 (26.0°C) is on target. Coil valve is already at 1.0, so water-side capacity cannot be increased further. 2) Assess CO2/ventilation: Zones 1 (1023 ppm, rising) and 3 (1018 ppm, rising) are above 1000 ppm and trending up; Zones 2 (998 ppm, falling) and 4 (898 ppm, rising) are acceptable. We must raise ventilation effectiveness for Zones 1 and 3 while minimizing outdoor-air fraction due to hot/humid OA and coil already maxed. 3) Power trade-off: With coil w=1.0, additional capacity must come from airflow.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state vs objectives:
- Comfort (target 26C within 25–27C): Z1 25.7 (slightly cool), Z2 26.3 (slightly warm), Z3 26.0 (on target), Z4 26.5 (warm, drifting up). Coil_valve already at 1.0, so water-side capacity is maxed.
- CO2: Z1 1029 ppm (+1/min), Z2 1011 ppm (+2.3/min), Z3 1012 ppm (-0.8/min), Z4 898 ppm (flat). Several zones are >1000 ppm and two are rising; must not exceed 1050 and should drive ≤1000. Outdoor air is hot/humid (34.2C, high AH), so adding OA increases cooling load.

2) Control priorities and constraints:
- CO2 requires more outdoor air delivery (absolute OA flow = OA_frac * total_supply_flow). We can increase OA fraction and/or total supply airflow. Keep OA minimal otherwise.
- Cooling: With coil at 1.0, extra load from OA must be offset primarily by modest increases in fan (air-side Q) and by distributing airflow toward warmer/high-CO2 zones via dampers.
- Energy: Fan and pump power ~ cubic; pump already max. Prefer small fan increases and damper optimization. Keep at least one zone damper at 100% to minimize static pressure.

3) Strategy:
- Increase OA damper moderately (avoid overshoot) to reverse CO2 rises in Z1/Z2 while limiting added load.
- Slightly increase fan speed to raise total supply air and absolute OA flow (helps both CO2 dilution and sensible cooling), but keep the change small to contain fan power.
- Damper redistribution: keep Z1 at 100% (static-pressure reference and high CO2), open Z2 to 100% (high CO2 and slightly warm), trim Z3 slightly (CO2 already declining, temp on target), and open Z4 modestly (warm and drifting up) to provide more cooling without over-ventilating.

4) Predicted effects:
- OA damper 0.34 -> 0.42 (~+24% OA fraction). Fan 0.77 -> 0.82 (~+6.5% speed). Combined with damper changes, absolute OA to Z1/Z2 increases on the order of ~30–40%, likely turning their CO2 trends negative within this interval and moving toward ≤1000 ppm; comfortably avoids 1050 ppm.
- Cooling: More airflow to Z2 and Z4 should pull them closer to 26C despite the warmer OA; Z3 remains near 26C with slight damper trim; Z1 stays within band. Coil remains at 1.0 to handle added latent/sensible load.
- Energy: Fan power increases roughly (0.82/0.77)^3 ≈ +21%. Pump unchanged (already max). This is justified to meet CO2 and comfort; once CO2 is back ≤1000, OA can be reduced and fan potentially reset down.

5) Smoothness and limits:
- All changes are moderate; at least one damper (actually two) at 100% to maintain efficient static-pressure reset. All actuators within bounds.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.85, 0.58], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.82}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state: All zones within 25–27°C. Z1=25.7 (slightly cool), Z2=26.3 (slightly warm), Z3=26.0 (on target), Z4=26.4 (slightly warm). CO2: Z1=1000 ppm trending down (-2.4 ppm/min), others 861–987 ppm also trending down. Outdoor air is hot/humid (34.1°C, high AH), so lowering OA reduces coil/chiller load. 2) Ventilation/CO2: Because all zones are ≤1000 ppm and falling, reduce OA toward minimum to cut load, but do it smoothly to avoid flipping CO2 trends positive. Step OA from 0.42 → 0.30 (moderate reduction). Expect CO2 slopes to become less negative but remain ≤1000; Z1 is the critical zone and should stay safe over 5 minutes. 3) Air vs. water trade-off and power: Fan and pump power scale ~cube. Prefer water-side modulation over fan for load changes. With OA reduced, sensible/latent load drops; we can back off coil slightly from 1.00 → 0.94 to save pump/chiller power while keeping comfort. Avoid fan increase; avoid fan decrease for now because Z2/Z4 are warmish and Z2 is already at 100% damper. 4) Static-pressure reset and balancing: Keep at least one zone damper 100% open to minimize throttling. Leave Z2 at 1.0. Rebalance: throttle the cool zone Z1 slightly (1.00 → 0.95) and Z3 slightly (0.78 → 0.75) to free capacity; open warm Z4 (0.70 → 0.85). 5) Fan speed: Hold at 0.82 to maintain current airflow since two zones are warm; lowering fan now risks comfort and would require more coil which is already being reduced. 6) Bound/smoothness check: All commands within bounds and are moderate changes. Expected outcomes in next 5 minutes: Z4 cools toward ≈26.2–26.3, Z2 holds near 26.2–26.3, Z1 drifts toward 26.0 due to slight damper reduction, Z3 near 26.0.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone 2 and Zone 4 are slightly warm (26.3°C); Zone 3 is on setpoint (26.0°C); Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.7°C). CO2: Zone 1 is 1015 ppm and rising (+2.6 ppm/min), Zones 2 and 3 are near 1000 ppm (998 and 995) and rising (+2.1 and +1.8 ppm/min). Outdoor air is hot/humid (34°C, high AH), so OA should be minimized except to satisfy CO2 limits. 2) Primary constraint: CO2 needs correction. With OA at 0.30, multiple zones will exceed 1000 ppm soon; Zone 1 is already above 1000 and rising. Increase OA fraction enough to halt/reverse the rise while avoiding excessive energy penalty. 3) Energy trade-offs: For added cooling load from more OA, prefer increasing coil_valve (pump-side) over fan speed (fan power is cubic and typically costlier per unit load). Keep at least one zone damper fully open for static-pressure reset (minimize throttling). 4) Control decisions: - OA damper: Increase from 0.30 to 0.42 (~+40%) to significantly boost ventilation and bring CO2 trends toward zero/negative across zones, while staying below extremes. - Coil valve: Increase slightly from 0.94 to 0.98 to offset added sensible/latent load from higher OA and to nudge Zones 2/4 toward 26°C. Pump power rises, but this is generally cheaper than raising fan speed. - Fan speed: Slightly reduce from 0.82 to 0.80 to shave fan power (≈7% fan power reduction via cubic scaling). Despite the small fan reduction, absolute OA flow still increases substantially because OA fraction rises (net OA intake ≈ +36%). - Zone dampers: Keep at least one 100% open. Maintain Zone 2 at 1.0 (it’s slightly warm). Keep Zone 1 at 0.95 (avoid extra cooling while OA increase handles its CO2). Trim Zone 3 from 0.75 to 0.70 (it’s exactly on setpoint) to reduce throttling losses and bias flow to warmer zones. Keep Zone 4 at 0.85 (slightly warm but already cooling). 5) Constraints and smoothness: All actuators within bounds. Changes are moderate; OA change is larger due to CO2 need. Static-pressure reset preserved with Zone 2 at 1.0.

CO2: Zone 1 is 1005 ppm but trending downward; to reduce energy and still move CO2 toward ≤1000 ppm without risking a rise, outdoor air is stepped down moderately (not to minimum yet). To cut power, we trim coil water flow (pump power cubic) and reduce outdoor air (cuts chiller/coil load) while keeping fan speed steady to avoid starving Zone 2. Zone dampers are adjusted to slightly ease cooling in cooler zones and favor Zone 2, maintaining at least one damper fully open to minimize throttling. Changes are moderate to avoid oscillations. Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes: CO2 continues trending toward ≤1000 ppm, Zone 2 receives proportionally more flow, and total power drops via lower coil valve and OA.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 1.0, 0.7, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.25, ""coil_valve"": 0.9, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Current status vs targets: All zones within 25–27°C; Z2 (26.4°C) is warmest, Z1 (25.8°C) coolest but rising slightly. CO2: Z1=999 ppm (falling), others 843–986 ppm (all falling). OA is 0.43, coil valve high (0.97), fan at 0.80. Outdoor air is hot/humid (35.1°C, 0.0197 kg/kg), so OA adds load. 2) CO2 and OA strategy: Because all CO2 values are ≤1000 ppm and trending down, reduce OA to cut load/power while keeping Z1 ≤1000 ppm and still decreasing. Use a conservative reduction from 0.43 to 0.36 (~−16.3%). Estimate Z1 CO2 trend scaling with OA fraction and zone flow: new rate ≈ −2.6 ppm/min × (0.36/0.43) × (new_Z1_damper/old_Z1_damper). With Z1 damper slightly reduced to 0.95, factor ≈ 0.837×0.95=0.795 → new rate ≈ −2.07 ppm/min → ~−10 ppm over 5 min → ~989 ppm. Safe and ≤1000. 3) Power/capacity trade-off: Q ≈ k_air·f + k_water·w; power ∝ f^3 and w^3, and water-side is typically cheaper per unit Q. Reduce fan slightly and lean on coil a bit. Also, lowering OA reduces chiller load and required Q. 4) Dampers and static pressure: Keep at least one damper 100% open to minimize throttling/static pressure. Make Z2 = 1.0 (it needs cooling). Shift flow toward Z2 and Z3; slightly trim Z1 (coolest) and Z4 (acceptable) to redistribute flow. 5) Setpoints choices: - OA damper: 0.36 to lower load while keeping CO2 trending down in all zones. - Coil valve: slight increase to 0.99 to offset a small fan reduction and cool Z2/Z3. - Fan speed: reduce to 0.78 (small step) to save cubic fan power while maintaining capacity via coil and damper redistribution. - Zone dampers: Z2=1.0 (anchor fully open), Z3=0.9 (needs a bit more), Z1=0.95 (slightly cool, also CO2 still OK), Z4=0.55 (still within comfort). 6) Expected outcomes next 5 min: CO2 decreases in all zones (Z1 ≈ 989 ppm, Z2 ≈ 976 ppm, Z3 ≈ 970 ppm, Z4 ≈ 835 ppm). Temperatures: added capacity directed to Z2/Z3 should nudge them toward 26°C; Z1 should drift toward 26°C due to slightly less flow; Z4 may hold near 26.2°C. 7) Smoothness and bounds: All changes are modest and within bounds; at least one damper (Z2) is 100% open for static-pressure reset; OA minimized within CO2 constraints.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 1.0, 0.9, 0.55], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 0.99, ""fan_speed"": 0.78}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone 2 is a bit warm (26.4°C), Zones 3–4 are 26.2°C, Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.8°C). CO2: Zone 1 is 1004 ppm and rising (+0.9 ppm/min), which violates the ≤1000 ppm target and risks nearing the hard cap of 1050 ppm; other zones are ≤ 1000 ppm. Outdoor air is hot/humid (35°C, high AH), so extra OA raises coil/chiller load. Coil valve is already near max (0.99), fan at 0.78, OA damper at 0.36. Step 2 – Control priorities: (a) Get Zone 1 CO2 below 1000 promptly, (b) keep all zones near 26°C, (c) minimize power and OA. Step 3 – Strategy selection: Prefer water-side capacity first, but coil is effectively maxed (set to 1.0). To reduce Zone 1 CO2 with minimal OA increase, redistribute airflow toward Zone 1 while keeping at least one damper 100% open to minimize static pressure (and fan power). Keep Zone 2 at 100% open (it’s warmest) and set Zone 1 to 100% to boost its ventilation; slightly throttle Zones 3–4 (both comfortable and with safe CO2) to shift flow. Step 4 – OA and fan adjustments: Increase OA only modestly to ensure Zone 1 CO2 trend reverses and drops below 1000 within the 5‑min window. A small fan increase offsets the added OA load, boosts dilution, and helps cool Zone 2 without large cubic fan power penalties. Step 5 – Smoothness and bounds: All changes are small-to-moderate and within actuator limits, avoiding oscillations. Step 6 – Expected outcomes: Zone 1 ventilation increases by a combination of damper redistribution, slight OA increase, and a small fan increase—targeting a clear negative CO2 trend to bring it under 1000 ppm within the interval. Zone 2 should cool slightly. Zones 3–4 may warm marginally but remain within 25–27°C and maintain CO2 well below limits.

    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.8°C). CO2: Zone 1 is at 1000 ppm and creeping up (+0.1 ppm/min), others are below 1000 ppm with small positive trends. Outdoor air is hot/humid (34.8°C, AH 0.019), so OA increases raise cooling load. 2) Objectives/constraints: Keep temps near 26°C, keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never >1050), minimize OA, and minimize electrical power. Use coil water before fan due to cubic power and higher pump efficiency; keep at least one zone damper at 100% open to reduce static pressure needs. Avoid large/sudden moves. 3) Ventilation/CO2 strategy: Zone 1 at 1000 ppm indicates slightly more OA ventilation is needed to stop the rise. Increase OA fraction minimally. To avoid a large power penalty, reduce fan slightly and bias cooling via water (coil valve). Keep Zone 1 damper at 1.0 to maximize its ventilation share. 4) Thermal/load strategy: Slightly increase coil_valve to boost sensible capacity without large fan increases. Re-distribute airflow: open dampers a bit more to warmer Zones 2 and 4, trim Zone 3 slightly. Maintain at least one damper at 100% (Zone 1) for static-pressure reset. Gently reduce fan speed to save power while the increased coil maintains Q. 5) Energy trade-off check (relative indices): Baseline OA cfm index ≈ 0.82*0.35 = 0.287. Proposed ≈ 0.80*0.37 = 0.296 (+~3.1% OA cfm to arrest Zone 1 CO2 rise). Fan power: 0.82^3 ≈ 0.551 → 0.80^3 ≈ 0.512 (~-7%). Pump power: 0.95^3 ≈ 0.857 → 0.98^3 ≈ 0.941 (~+9.8%). Given pumps are typically more efficient than fans, this shift is acceptable; plus improved damper distribution should lower throttling losses. 6) Expected outcomes over next 5 min: - Zone 1 CO2 should stabilize or nudge below 1000 ppm due to +~3% OA cfm and damper at 1.0. - Zones 2 and 4 should cool slightly toward 26°C thanks to more damper opening and slightly colder coil; Zone 3 remains near 26.2°C. Zone 1 temperature may hold or drift slightly; risk of <25°C is low over 5 minutes given a small fan reduction. 7) Smoothness: All actuator changes are modest to avoid oscillations; static-pressure requirement maintained with at least one damper at 100% open.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.98, 0.75, 0.6], ""oa_damper"": 0.37, ""coil_valve"": 0.98, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of reasoning and trade-offs (concise):
- Comfort status: All zones within 25–27°C; Zones 2 and 3 are slightly warm (26.4, 26.2) and should be nudged toward 26°C. Zone 1 is at 25.9 (good), Zone 4 at 26.3 (acceptable).
- CO2 status: Zone 1 is at 1005 ppm and rising (~+0.9 ppm/min), exceeding the 1000 ppm target. Others are ≤ 1000 ppm. Priority is to promptly reverse Zone 1’s CO2 trend while avoiding overshoot elsewhere.
- Energy trade-offs: Outdoor air (OA) is hot/humid (35°C, high AH), so OA greatly increases cooling/chiller load. However, due to the current CO2 violation, a temporary increase in OA fraction is warranted. Avoid raising fan speed (P ∝ f^3); prefer using water-side (coil) and damper distribution. Keep at least one zone damper fully open for static-pressure reset.
- Control strategy this interval:

  ""thought_process"": ""Summary of reasoning and trade-offs (concise):\n- Comfort status: All zones within 25–27°C; Zones 2 and 3 are slightly warm (26.4, 26.2) and should be nudged toward 26°C. Zone 1 is at 25.9 (good), Zone 4 at 26.3 (acceptable).\n- CO2 status: Zone 1 is at 1005 ppm and rising (~+0.9 ppm/min), exceeding the 1000 ppm target. Others are ≤ 1000 ppm. Priority is to promptly reverse Zone 1’s CO2 trend while avoiding overshoot elsewhere.\n- Energy trade-offs: Outdoor air (OA) is hot/humid (35°C, high AH), so OA greatly increases cooling/chiller load. However, due to the current CO2 violation, a temporary increase in OA fraction is warranted. Avoid raising fan speed (P ∝ f^3); prefer using water-side (coil) and damper distribution. Keep at least one zone damper fully open for static-pressure reset.\n- Control strategy this interval:\n  1) Increase OA fraction moderately-aggressively to quickly drive Zone 1 CO2 downward (temporary, to be reduced once ≤ 990 ppm).\n  2) Keep fan speed steady to maintain ventilation effect without cubic fan power penalty.\n  3) Max the coil valve to offset the added OA load and gently pull Zones 2/3 toward 26°C via colder supply air, avoiding a fan increase.\n  4) Damper distribution: keep Zone 1 at 100% open; open Zone 2 to 100% to help cool it; slightly open Zone 3; keep Zone 4 as-is.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zones 2, 3, and 4 are slightly warm (26.3–26.4) and stable/slightly rising; Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.9) and rising slowly. 2) Assess CO2: All zones are below 1000 ppm and trending down. Zone 1 is highest at 985 ppm with a decreasing trend, giving short-term headroom to reduce OA without risk of exceeding 1000 ppm. 3) Outdoor air strategy: OA is hot and humid (35°C, high AH). To minimize coil/chiller and fan power while maintaining CO2 limits, reduce OA from 0.50 toward a lower value conservatively (to 0.20) to avoid a sudden reversal in CO2 trends.

Keep coil at 1.0 and reduce fan speed modestly to cut cubic fan power while relying on colder mixed/supply air from reduced OA to maintain comfort. 5) Static-pressure/damper strategy: Keep at least one zone damper fully open to minimize throttling and allow lower static/fan.

The modest fan increase plus wide-open dampers should slightly increase total sensible Q to pull 26.3–26.4°C toward 26°C while handling the extra OA load. 6) Smoothness and bounds: All changes are moderate relative to previous settings and within bounds.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning: 1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C, but Zones 2–4 are slightly warm (26.3–26.4°C). The cooling coil valve is already at 1.0, so additional sensible capacity must come from airflow (fan and damper distribution). 2) CO2: Zone 1 = 1037 ppm (rising), Zone 3 = 1002 ppm (rising), Zone 2 = 991 ppm (rising). To keep ≤1000 ppm and avoid exceeding 1050 ppm, we need a modest increase in outdoor air and total ventilation. 3) Power trade-offs: Pump/coil already maxed (coil_valve=1.0).

Increasing OA increases chiller/coil load; therefore, raise OA just enough to reverse the CO2 trend. 4) Static pressure: Keep at least one damper at 100% open to minimize throttling and fan pressure.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

2) Current state: Z1=26.0°C (on target), Z2=26.3°C, Z3=26.3°C, Z4=26.3°C (slightly warm but within band). Temperature trends are flat to slightly cooling. CO2: Z1=1000 ppm with a decreasing trend (−4.1 ppm/min), others 843–972 ppm and decreasing. OA damper is relatively high at 0.42; coil valve is maxed at 1.0; fan speed is 0.9. Three zone dampers are already 100% open, Z4 at 0.5.
3) Ventilation/CO2: Since Z1 CO2 is at 1000 ppm but trending down, we can reduce outdoor air slightly while keeping CO2 ≤ 1000. To avoid overshoot and oscillations, make a moderate reduction of OA from 0.42 to 0.36 so the CO2 in Z1 should remain stable or continue to decrease.
4) Cooling/load balance: Zones are a bit warm; coil is already at max (prefer water first, but no headroom). Reducing OA will lower mixed-air temperature and coil load, effectively improving sensible cooling without raising fan speed. To address Z4 being warm with damper at 0.5, open Z4 damper to increase local airflow while keeping others fully open to maintain low static losses.
5) Fan/pump energy: Avoid increasing fan (cubic power penalty); keep fan at 0.9. Keep coil at 1.0 (since we need cooling and water-side power is typically cheaper than fan-side for the same load; plus we’re using OA reduction to assist cooling).
6) Static pressure: Maintain at least one damper fully open (we keep three zones at 1.0); opening Z4 reduces throttling further. Changes are smooth/moderate to prevent oscillations.
7) Expected outcome (next 5 min): Slightly improved cooling via colder supply air and better distribution to Z4; zones should drift toward 26°C while CO2 remains ≤ 1000 ppm. Power drops due to reduced OA; fan and pump power unchanged (fan) or same (coil) this step.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.9}","{

Three zone dampers are already 100% open, Z4 at 0.5.\n3) Ventilation/CO2: Since Z1 CO2 is at 1000 ppm but trending down, we can reduce outdoor air slightly while keeping CO2 ≤ 1000. To avoid overshoot and oscillations, make a moderate reduction of OA from 0.42 to 0.36 so the CO2 in Z1 should remain stable or continue to decrease.\n4) Cooling/load balance: Zones are a bit warm; coil is already at max (prefer water first, but no headroom). Reducing OA will lower mixed-air temperature and coil load, effectively improving sensible cooling without raising fan speed. To address Z4 being warm with damper at 0.5, open Z4 damper to increase local airflow while keeping others fully open to maintain low static losses.\n5) Fan/pump energy: Avoid increasing fan (cubic power penalty); keep fan at 0.9. Keep coil at 1.0 (since we need cooling and water-side power is typically cheaper than fan-side for the same load; plus we’re using OA reduction to assist cooling).\n6) Static pressure: Maintain at least one damper fully open (we keep three zones at 1.0); opening Z4 reduces throttling further. Changes are smooth/moderate to prevent oscillations.\n7) Expected outcome (next 5 min): Slightly improved cooling via colder supply air and better distribution to Z4; zones should drift toward 26°C while CO2 remains ≤ 1000 ppm. Power drops due to reduced OA; fan and pump power unchanged (fan) or same (coil) this step."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of control logic: 1) Comfort: Zones 2 and 3 are slightly warm (26.3°C). Prefer increasing water-side cooling before fan due to cubic power scaling and higher fan penalty. Coil is already at max, so we reduce outdoor-air fraction to lower mixed-air temperature and coil load, which should increase delivered cooling without raising fan power. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is the limiting case at 998 ppm with a slight downward trend.

  ""thought_process"": ""Summary of control logic: 1) Comfort: Zones 2 and 3 are slightly warm (26.3°C). Prefer increasing water-side cooling before fan due to cubic power scaling and higher fan penalty. Coil is already at max, so we reduce outdoor-air fraction to lower mixed-air temperature and coil load, which should increase delivered cooling without raising fan power. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is the limiting case at 998 ppm with a slight downward trend.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C and near the 26°C target. Zone 2 is slightly warm (26.3°C) but stable; coil_valve is already at 1.0, so we should not reduce cooling. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is at 1002 ppm and rising (~+0.6 ppm/min). This is above the 1000 ppm target and must be corrected without exceeding 1050 ppm. Other zones (956–968 ppm) have headroom. 3) Strategy to lower CO2 while minimising energy: Keep outdoor air as low as possible per rule, but because Zone 1 is already >1000 ppm, we must increase effective ventilation to Zone 1. First, redistribute supply by keeping Zone 1 damper fully open and modestly throttling other zones to shift flow toward Zone 1, satisfying the static-pressure reset requirement (at least one damper at 100%). Second, make a small fan speed increase (water side is already maxed) to boost both sensible capacity (Q ≈ k_air·f + k_water·w) and total ventilation with a modest cubic fan power penalty. Third, apply only a minimal OA fraction increase to ensure Zone 1’s CO2 trend reverses downward; plan to pull OA back once CO2 < 1000 ppm with margin. 4) Power trade-offs: Coil valve (pump power) is already at max. Increasing fan slightly is preferable to a larger OA increase because OA at 35°C/humid raises coil/chiller load. The chosen settings use moderate damper redistribution, a small fan increase, and a slight OA bump to meet CO2 without large energy penalties. 5) Smoothness and constraints: Changes are modest from prior settings, all actuators within bounds, and Zone 1 damper remains at 100% open for static-pressure reset.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.9, 0.9, 0.82], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.9}","{

Zones 2 and 3 are slightly warm (~26.2°C), Zone 4 is slightly cool (25.9°C). Zone 1 CO2 is 999 ppm and slowly rising, so we should not reduce outdoor air or fan airflow this interval to avoid exceeding 1000 ppm.

To fine-tune comfort and minimise throttling, keep Zone 1 damper at 100% (for static-pressure reset and CO2 benefit), open Zones 2 and 3 to 100% to nudge them toward 26°C without raising fan speed, and trim Zone 4 damper slightly to reduce overcooling.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of reasoning: All zones are within 25–27°C and slightly trending cooler, so we have room to reduce cooling to save pump/chiller power. CO2 is the constraint: Zone 1 is at 1001 ppm and rising, Zone 3 is at 992 ppm and rising; without action both would exceed 1000 ppm next interval. To correct CO2 with minimal electrical power, increase outdoor-air fraction modestly (cheaper than increasing fan due to cubic fan power) and prioritize airflow to high-CO2 zones via damper positions while keeping at least one damper fully open for static-pressure reset. Keep fan speed steady to avoid cubic power increase and potential oscillations. Reduce coil valve moderately to cut pump/chiller power while remaining within comfort, accounting for slightly higher mixed-air temperature from increased OA. Make smooth adjustments. Expected effects over the next 5 minutes: OA increase plus fully open dampers for Zones 1 and 3 should reverse CO2 rise; coil reduction should flatten the slight overcooling trend without leaving the comfort band; holding fan speed avoids a power spike.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z1=25.7 (-0.01°C/min), Z2=25.8 (-0.02), Z3=26.0 (-0.01), Z4=25.8 (+0.01). CO2: Z1=998 ppm (-2.4 ppm/min), Z3=999 ppm (-1.4), Z2=957 (-1.9), Z4=866 (-0.3). Outdoor air is very hot/humid (35.7°C), so OA should be minimized to reduce cooling/humidity load. 2) Baseline projection (no change, 5 min): Z1 temp ~25.65, Z2 ~25.7, Z3 ~25.95, Z4 ~25.85 (all comfortable). CO2 projections: Z1 ~986, Z3 ~992.5 (both below 1000 with current ventilation). 3) Energy strategy: Pump/fan power ~ cubic; current coil_valve=0.93 is high. Reduce coil first (cheaper than fan) to cut cooling and nudge temps toward 26°C. Then modestly reduce fan to save power while keeping ventilation adequate. Keep at least one damper at 100% (we have three) to minimize static pressure. 4) Ventilation/CO2: Because Z1 and Z3 CO2 are just under 1000 but trending down, we can slightly reduce OA fraction and slightly reduce fan speed without exceeding 1000 ppm. Combining small reductions (~10% total OA flow reduction) should still keep CO2 slopes negative. Quick check: If OA flow reduces by ~9–10%, Z1 slope ~-2.4→~-2.17 ppm/min and Z3 ~-1.4→~-1.26 ppm/min; over 5 min gives ~-10.8 ppm and ~-6.3 ppm, yielding ~987 and ~993 ppm respectively—≤1000 and well below 1050. 5) Zone dampers: Keep Z1–Z3 at 1.0 to maintain low throttling and allow lower static pressure/fan speed. Keep Z4 at 0.45 since it’s slightly below setpoint and trending up; no need to add more cooling there. 6) Chosen adjustments (smooth to avoid oscillation): coil_valve 0.93→0.86 (pump power ↓), fan_speed 0.83→0.80 (fan power ↓), oa_damper 0.32→0.30 (reduce OA load but keep CO2 ≤1000). 7) Constraint check: All setpoints within bounds; at least one damper at 100%; actuators within min/max; expected CO2 stays below 1000 and far below 1050; reduced OA lowers coil/chiller load. 8) Next steps: Monitor Z1/Z3 CO2; if they continue to decrease, consider further OA reduction next interval; if CO2 rises near 1000, hold or slightly increase OA/fan.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1 – Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C and slightly cool vs 26°C target (Z1/Z2 at 25.7 and drifting down slightly; Z3 at 26.0 stable; Z4 at 25.8 and slowly rising). This allows reducing coil to save power while letting temps drift toward 26. Step 2 – CO2/ventilation: Z3 is the tightest at 998 ppm but trending downward; others are ≤ 994 ppm and decreasing. To keep CO2 ≤ 1000 with margin, avoid reducing OA this interval and keep at least one zone damper fully open to maintain low static pressure setpoint. Step 3 – Power trade-off: Per cubic scaling, prefer water-side (coil) adjustments before fan. Reduce coil valve to cut pump/chiller load and allow a small temperature rise toward 26. Then take a small fan trim to save cubic fan power while keeping ventilation adequate (OA held constant to protect CO2). Step 4 – Damper strategy (static-pressure reset): Keep multiple zones at 100% open to minimize throttling and enable lower fan pressure. Slightly open Zone 4 damper to arrest its warming and improve its ventilation; keep Zones 1–3 at 100% to anchor static pressure.

We can reduce cooling/airflow modestly to move closer to 26°C and save power. 2) CO2: Z1=990 ppm, Z3=997 ppm are near the 1000 ppm target but trending down at current settings; Z2=950, Z4=863 are comfortable.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort check: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. Z3 is slightly above setpoint (26.1°C, slight upward trend), Z1 and Z2 are slightly cool (25.6–25.7°C, flat), Z4 is 25.9°C with a slight upward trend. No aggressive temperature correction needed.
2) CO2/ventilation: Z3 is at 1005 ppm (>1000) and rising (+1.6 ppm/min). Z1 is 999 ppm and rising (+1.7 ppm/min). Immediate action is required to prevent exceeding 1050 ppm and to drive both toward ≤1000 ppm. Z2 and Z4 are fine.
3) Energy strategy: Outdoor air is hot and humid; increasing OA fraction is costly. To meet CO2 constraints with minimal energy, first redistribute airflow toward high-CO2 zones and apply a small fan increase to boost dilution (fan power ~ f^3, so keep changes modest). Only a small OA fraction increase will be used as a safety margin to ensure Z3 and Z1 trend downward. Coil valve impacts temperature, not dilution; since temperatures are acceptable, avoid increasing coil (pump/chiller) load.
4) Damper redistribution: Keep Z1 and Z3 at 100% open to satisfy static-pressure reset logic and minimize throttling losses. Throttle Z2 and Z4 moderately to push more supply (and hence OA) to Z1/Z3: Z2 to 0.85 and Z4 to 0.40. This increases Z1/Z3 shares by ~10–12% without raising total flow.
5) Fan/OA adjustments: Increase fan speed slightly from 0.68→0.71 (~+4.4% flow; fan power ~+14%) to improve dilution system-wide. Nudge OA damper from 0.30→0.315 (~+5% OA cfm with the fan change) to ensure Z3’s CO2 turns downward within the next 5 minutes while keeping OA near minimum.
6) Coil valve: Hold at 0.70. With slightly higher OA and flow, supply air temperature may rise a touch, which helps prevent overcooling in Z1/Z2, while remaining within comfort band. Pump/chiller power is not increased unnecessarily.
7) Expected outcomes (next 5 minutes): Z3 and Z1 CO2 should reverse trend and move toward ≤1000 ppm, staying well below 1050 ppm. Temperatures should remain within 25–27°C; Z2 and Z4 may drift slightly warmer toward 26°C.

    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z1=25.6 (-0.4C), Z2=25.7 (-0.3C), Z3=26.1 (+0.1C), Z4=26.1 (+0.1C). Small tweaks only; prefer staying near 26°C. 2) Check CO2/ventilation: Z3=1007 ppm (>1000) with flat trend; must bring down. Z1=999 ppm with slight decrease; avoid any action that would reduce its ventilation. Z2=962 trending up slowly; Z4=875 trending up slowly. 3) OA strategy: Outdoor air is very hot/humid (35.3°C), so increasing OA fraction is costly. Keep OA fraction unchanged if possible; use a small fan increase to raise total ventilation to all zones (reducing CO2) while minimizing added OA fraction. 4) Airflow vs. water flow: We need more ventilation, which requires more airflow. To avoid overcooling due to increased air, slightly reduce coil valve to keep zone temps near 26°C and recoup some pump/chiller energy. 5) Static-pressure logic: Keep at least one damper at 100% open; we already have two (Z1, Z3). Slightly open Z4 damper to reduce throttling and better balance, as its temp is just above setpoint and trending up; leave Z2 damper unchanged to avoid reducing its ventilation. 6) Power trade-offs (cubic scaling): Increase fan modestly from 0.71→0.73 (~+8.8% fan power). Reduce coil valve 0.68→0.67 (~-4.4% pump power).

Outdoor air is hot and humid, so reducing OA lowers coil/chiller load. Strategy: Reduce cooling and fan modestly to save power while keeping comfort. Use water-side (coil valve) as primary lever (cheaper than fan for same load), fine-tune with zone dampers, and keep one damper fully open to allow lower static pressure. Reduce OA fraction but not to minimum to avoid a sudden CO2 increase (step down smoothly).

Use water-side (coil valve) as primary lever (cheaper than fan for same load), fine-tune with zone dampers, and keep one damper fully open to allow lower static pressure. Reduce OA fraction but not to minimum to avoid a sudden CO2 increase (step down smoothly). Commands: 1) Lower coil valve moderately to reduce overcooling. 2) Slightly reduce fan speed to leverage cubic fan power savings. 3) Keep Zone 3 damper at 100% for static-pressure reset; trim Z1 damper to limit overcooling; open Z2 and Z4 slightly to hold near 26°C as coil cooling is reduced. 4) Reduce OA damper toward minimum but keep a buffer to maintain CO2 margin. All changes are within bounds and smooth. Expected outcome: Temperatures remain near 26°C; CO2 stays <1000 ppm; total power drops via lower fan, pump, and OA load."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort check: All zones are within 25–27°C and near the 26°C target. Z1=25.6 (slightly cool), Z2=25.8, Z3=26.0, Z4=26.1; temperature trends are small, so comfort is stable.
2) CO2 risk and short-term forecast (5 min at current settings): Z1=1010 ppm rising ~+4.6 ppm/min → ~+23 ppm to ~1033 (already >1000 and worsening). Z2=995 rising ~+4.9 ppm/min → ~1019 (>1000). Z3=990 rising ~+1.9 ppm/min → ~1000 (borderline). Z4=868, safe. We must increase ventilation promptly to bring Z1 ≤1000 and keep others from crossing 1000 while never approaching 1050.
3) Strategy to minimize power while fixing CO2: Prefer water-side (coil_valve) adjustments over fan_speed due to cubic power penalty on fan. Increase outdoor air fraction only as much as needed; redistribute airflow toward high-CO2 zones using zone dampers. Maintain at least one zone damper at 100% open for static-pressure reset to avoid unnecessary fan power.
4) Chosen actions:
   - OA_damper: increase from 0.22 → 0.38 to reverse CO2 rise in Z1/Z2 and protect Z3. This is a decisive but not extreme step given Z1 already >1000 ppm.
   - Zone dampers: open Z1 to 1.0 (becomes the 100% reference), open Z2 to 0.95 to prioritize ventilation there; slightly reduce Z3 to 0.85 (still adequate, near target CO2/temperature); keep Z4 at 0.50 (it’s comfortable and low CO2). This shifts more of the available flow and OA to the zones that need it without raising fan speed.
   - Fan_speed: hold at 0.70 to avoid cubic fan power increase; damper redistribution plus higher OA fraction should deliver the needed ventilation.
   - Coil_valve: nudge up from 0.66 → 0.68 to offset added heat/moisture from warmer, humid OA (34.6°C, AH 0.0181), helping keep zone temps near 26°C without overcooling.
5) Power and constraints check: All actuators within bounds. One damper (Z1) at 100% for static-pressure reset. We avoided increasing fan (largest cubic penalty) and used modest coil increase instead. OA increased only as much as needed to correct CO2 promptly.
6) Expected next-interval outcome: Z1/Z2 CO2 trends should flatten and begin to decrease (Z1 should move back toward ≤1000 ppm; Z2 should remain ≲1000–1010 then decline), Z3 around ~995–1000 stabilized, Z4 remains low. Temperatures should stay within 25–27°C, likely closer to 26°C given the slight coil increase balancing warmer OA. We will look to reduce OA and coil next interval if CO2 trajectories are safely negative.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.95, 0.85, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.68, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Z1=25.6 (slightly cool, flat trend), Z2=25.8 (slightly cool, near-flat), Z3=26.0 (on target), Z4=26.1 (slightly warm). Aim to nudge Z1/Z2 up toward 26 without letting Z4 rise.
2) CO2 status: Z1=999 ppm with a decreasing trend (-2.1 ppm/min); others are 855–989 ppm and also decreasing. We can cautiously reduce outdoor air, but keep enough margin because Z1 is near 1000 ppm. Maintain smooth, small changes.
3) Energy trade-offs: Fan power ∝ f^3, pump power ∝ w^3 (coil_valve as proxy). Increasing coil (water) is usually cheaper than increasing fan; since cooling demand is light and temps are slightly cool overall, we can reduce both fan and coil slightly. Also reduce OA a bit to cut latent/sensible load on the coil.
4) Air distribution and static pressure reset: Keep at least one damper at 100% to minimize throttling/static pressure. Keep Zone 1 damper at 1.0. Shift some airflow toward Z4 (slightly warm) and trim Z2/Z3 slightly to allow them to warm toward 26 while preserving a fully-open damper.
5) Proposed smooth adjustments from previous: 
   - Zone dampers: keep Z1=1.0; decrease Z2 0.95→0.90 and Z3 0.85→0.80 to let them warm slightly; increase Z4 0.50→0.55 to avoid further warming with the global cooling reduction.
   - OA damper: reduce 0.38→0.36 (≈5% drop) to lower latent/sensible load while CO2 trends remain negative; combined with a very small fan reduction, OA volumetric flow falls modestly (~6–7%).
   - Fan speed: reduce 0.70→0.69 (small step) to save fan power and allow Z1/Z2 to drift up toward setpoint.
   - Coil valve: reduce 0.68→0.66 to save pump/chiller power; overall capacity drops slightly but zone damper tweaks keep Z4 from rising.
6) Constraint check: One damper at 100% (Z1), all actuators within bounds, small incremental changes to avoid oscillations. CO2: with OA and fan slightly reduced, the previously negative CO2 slopes should remain negative; Z1 should move below 995 ppm within the interval, maintaining ≤1000 ppm and well below 1050 ppm.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state: All zones are within the 25–27°C band. Z4 is slightly warm (26.1°C, warming). Z1 is a bit cool (25.6°C, flat). CO2: Z1 = 1002 ppm and rising (+0.3 ppm/min), Z2 = 999 ppm rising (+0.2), Z3 = 984 ppm rising fastest (+0.7), Z4 = 845 ppm. Outdoor air is hot/humid (34.1°C, 0.018 kg/kg), so OA is costly.
2) Objectives: Pull CO2 down to ≤1000 ppm without exceeding 1050, minimize OA intake, keep temps near 26°C, and minimize power with cubic fan/pump scaling. Prefer coil valve (water flow) over large fan increases; keep at least one zone damper at 100% open to lower static pressure needs.
3) Ventilation strategy: Because Z1 is already above 1000 and Z2 is at 999 with rising trends, incremental ventilation is needed. To minimize energy, use a small OA fraction increase plus a modest fan increase—this yields more OA mass flow with a limited fan penalty, avoiding a large OA jump that would sharply raise chiller/coil load. Keep Z1 and Z2 dampers at 1.0 to prioritize their ventilation and maintain static-pressure reset (at least one wide open). Preempt Z3’s rise by opening its damper slightly. Nudge Z4 damper up a bit to counter its warming without a big coil increase.
4) Thermal/capacity adjustments: Slightly increase coil valve to offset the extra load from higher flow and a modest OA fraction increase, aiming to keep zones near 26°C while avoiding overcooling. Avoid large fan changes to limit fan power (∝ f^3).
5) Power rationale: Fan from 0.62 to 0.64 is a small increase (fan power ↑ ~10%). Coil valve from 0.55 to 0.58 increases pump power modestly; typically cheaper than a large fan increase. OA fraction increases only to the minimum likely needed to arrest CO2 rise.
6) Static pressure: Keep Z1 and Z2 at 100% open to minimize throttling and support lower static pressure requirements.
7) Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes: Increased OA and slightly higher flow should stop and begin reversing CO2 rise in Z1/Z2 while keeping Z3 trending safely below 1000. Temperatures should remain within 25–27°C, with Z4 nudged closer to 26°C. Changes are smooth to avoid oscillations.
8) Bounds check: All actuator commands are within provided limits and changes are moderate.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.35], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.58, ""fan_speed"": 0.64}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of decisions and rationale:
- Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.7°C) but trending up; Zones 2–3 slightly warm (26.1°C) with small upward drift; Zone 4 is cooling slightly.
- CO2 status: Zones 1 and 2 are at ~1000 ppm and trending upward; action is required to keep them ≤1000 ppm without exceeding 1050 ppm.
- Ventilation strategy: Minimize outdoor air but add just enough to arrest CO2 rise. Increase OA damper slightly and bias supply airflow toward Zones 1 and 2 by opening their dampers and trimming Zones 3–4. Keep at least one damper at 100% open to satisfy static-pressure reset logic and reduce throttling.
- Energy trade-offs: Avoid increasing fan speed due to cubic power penalty; use water-side (coil valve) modestly to handle added OA heat and maintain comfort. Reducing OA is generally energy-favorable, but a small increase is needed for CO2 compliance; compensate via coil rather than fan.
- Smooth changes: Adjustments are small-to-moderate to avoid oscillations and remain within bounds.
- Expected outcome next 5 minutes: Zones 1–2 receive more dilution air, keeping CO2 at or below 1000 ppm; temperatures stay near 26°C. If CO2 trends negative, plan to trim OA slightly in the next interval to reduce chiller load further.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.85, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.62}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","High-level rationale: All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band, with Zones 2–3 slightly above 26°C and trending slowly upward. CO2 is acceptable but Zone 1 is near 1000 ppm; other zones are declining, suggesting outdoor air is slightly more than needed. To reduce total power, prefer water-side adjustment over fan due to cubic power scaling and better pump efficiency. Strategy this interval: slightly lower fan speed and reduce throttling by opening dampers (keep at least one damper at 100% to enable lower static pressure), compensate sensible capacity with a small coil-valve increase, and cautiously trim outdoor air to reduce latent/sensible load while keeping CO2 within limits.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess state: All zones are within 25–27°C, though Z2 is on the warm side (26.5°C) and several zones have a slight warming trend (~+0.01°C/min). CO2: Z1=1018 ppm and Z2=1016 ppm are above the 1000 ppm goal but trending down; well below the 1050 ppm hard limit. Outdoor air is very hot/humid (33.6°C, high AH), so added OA is energetically costly. 2) Objectives and constraints: Bring CO2 in Z1/Z2 down toward ≤1000 ppm without overshooting energy; maintain temps near 26°C; minimize OA intake; use water flow before fan for cooling; keep at least one damper fully open; make smooth changes. 3) Ventilation strategy: To reduce CO2 while minimizing OA energy, modestly increase total airflow (which increases absolute OA flow) but slightly reduce OA fraction so mixed-air conditions are less severe. This maintains/increases ventilation effectiveness with lower OA fraction. 4) Thermal/energy trade-off: Increase fan slightly (f^3 power rise) but decrease coil valve slightly (w^3 power drop) to keep net electrical roughly neutral while maintaining cooling capacity via increased air-side contribution.

Proposed: fan=0.60 (P≈0.216), valve=0.74 (P≈0.405) → net ≈ -0.002 in normalized power; plus reduced OA fraction helps chiller load. 5) Dampers/static pressure: Keep Z1 and Z2 at 100% open to minimize throttling and allow lower static pressure requirement. Slightly open Z3 and Z4 to reduce throttling and bias a touch more cooling to them, which will help nudge all zones toward 26°C. 6) Smoothness and safety: All changes are small.

Zone 2 is warmest at 26.6°C (+0.6C), others are 26.1–26.3°C. CO2 is 784–984 ppm and trending down strongly in all zones. Outdoor air is very hot and humid (33.8°C, high moisture). Previous settings had high OA (0.60), coil 0.76, fan 0.62, with Z1 and Z2 dampers fully open.
2) Ventilation/CO2: Since all zones’ CO2 are <1000 ppm and decreasing, we can reduce OA to cut chiller load. To avoid a drastic step and keep CO2 comfortably ≤1000, set OA to 0.30 (half of previous 0.60). With OA previously giving ~−5 ppm/min in worst case, ~0.30 should still keep CO2 stable or gently decreasing over the next 5 minutes, maintaining ≤1000 ppm with large margin to 1050 ppm.
3) Energy trade-off: Fan and pump scale ~cube of their commands. Prefer water-side modulation over fan for load changes. Also, reducing OA fraction lowers mixed-air enthalpy, reducing coil/chiller power for the same zone conditions.
4) Airflow/static pressure: Keep at least one damper at 100% to minimize static pressure requirement. Retain Z2 at 1.0 (it is the warmest) and keep Z1 at 1.0 as an additional wide-open path. Slightly trim Z3 and Z4 to bias airflow toward Z2 and prevent overcooling, while maintaining smooth changes (−0.05 each).
5) Fan vs coil: Implement a small fan speed reduction (0.62→0.60) to capture cubic fan power savings and rely on water-side and reduced OA load to maintain comfort. Hold coil valve at 0.76 to avoid overshoot/oscillation; reduced OA should modestly increase effective cooling per unit air, helping pull Zone 2 toward 26°C without needing more fan.
6) Expected 5-min outcome: Zone 2 should start trending down from 26.6°C toward 26.4–26.5°C; other zones move slightly closer to 26°C. CO2 should remain below 1000 ppm with OA=0.30. Energy drops due to lower fan speed and significantly reduced OA load (chiller). Changes are smooth and within bounds, with at least one damper fully open.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state: All zone temps are within 25–27°C; Zone 2 is warmest at 26.6°C (flat trend). CO2 in Zones 1 and 2 is 1003 ppm and rising (~+4 ppm/min), slightly above the 1000 ppm target and will drift higher if unchanged. Outdoor air is hot and humid (34°C, high AH), so OA increases add sensible/latent load. 2) Control priorities: Bring CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm without overspending energy. Prefer increasing coil (water-side) over fan due to cubic power scaling and typically higher pump efficiency. Keep OA minimal but sufficient to reverse CO2 rise. Maintain at least one zone damper fully open for static-pressure reset. 3) Ventilation strategy: Slightly increase OA damper enough to reverse the CO2 rise in Zones 1–2 while not excessively increasing latent load. From 0.30 to 0.38 provides a meaningful bump in dilution without being excessive. Additionally, bias airflow toward Zones 1–2 (highest CO2 and Zone 2 is warmest) by slightly throttling Zones 3–4; keep Zones 1–2 at 100% to maintain low static pressure losses. 4) Thermal strategy: Because added OA raises load, slightly increase coil valve (water flow) to maintain/trim temps, particularly helping Zone 2 move toward 26°C. Avoid increasing fan speed to limit cubic fan power; rely on coil and damper redistribution. 5) Power trade-offs: Keep fan at 0.60 to avoid cubic penalty; small coil increase (0.76→0.78) raises pump power modestly and is typically cheaper than boosting fan. OA increase is limited to the minimum expected to correct CO2. 6) Smoothness/constraints: Changes are modest to avoid oscillations. Ensure at least one damper is 100% open (Zones 1 and 2).

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1 – Assess comfort and trends: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z2 (26.6°C, flat) and Z3 (26.4°C, slightly rising) and Z4 (26.5°C, rising) are a bit warm; Z1 is at 26.0°C and drifting slightly cooler. Outdoor air is very hot (33.3°C), so reducing OA helps chiller load but is constrained by CO2. Step 2 – Assess CO2/ventilation: Z1=994 ppm (-1.9 ppm/min) and Z2=997 ppm (-1.7 ppm/min) are close to the 1000 ppm cap but trending downward with OA=0.45 and fan=0.62. Any meaningful reduction in outdoor air or total flow risks reversing those trends, so keep OA roughly steady for safety. Step 3 – Power trade-offs: Fan power scales ~f^3; pump power scales ~w^3. With coil_valve already high (0.9), it’s more efficient to shave fan speed slightly if CO2 safety is preserved. A small fan reduction (0.62→0.60) cuts fan power ~9% (0.62^3≈0.238 to 0.60^3≈0.216) while likely keeping CO2 trends negative given current margins. Step 4 – Coil/water-side: Avoid increasing coil above 0.90 to limit pump/chiller power, since all zones are already within the comfort band. Keeping w steady while slightly reducing f balances energy savings and comfort. Step 5 – Zone damper strategy and static-pressure reset: Keep at least one damper fully open to minimize static-pressure requirements. Hold Zone 2 at 1.0 (needs cooling and ventilation). Trim Zone 1 from 1.0→0.90 to prevent overcooling and reallocate some flow. Nudge Zone 3 from 0.45→0.50 and Zone 4 from 0.20→0.30 to counter their slight warm trends without large total flow increases. Step 6 – CO2 and comfort check: With OA held at 0.45 and only a 0.02 fan reduction, Z1/Z2 CO2 trends should remain negative or near-zero over the next 5 minutes, keeping both ≤1000 ppm. Temperature impacts should be small: Z2 may stay near 26.6°C; Z3/Z4 get modestly more airflow to arrest rises; Z1 should remain close to 26°C. Step 7 – Smoothness/bounds: All changes are small to avoid oscillations and all actuators are clipped within bounds. At least one zone damper (Z2) remains at 100% to support static-pressure reset.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 1.0, 0.5, 0.3], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.9, ""fan_speed"": 0.6}","{

Current cooling rates (-0.02 to -0.05°C/min) are too small to bring zones into the 25–27°C band soon; we must increase sensible cooling. Outdoor air is hot and humid (30.7°C, high AH), so economizing with OA is unfavorable. 2) CO2/ventilation: All zones are low (455–507 ppm) with modest rises; even at minimum OA they will remain far below 1000 ppm in the next interval. Keep OA at minimum to reduce latent/sensible load and chiller power. 3) Energy trade-off: Use water-side first because pump power scales cubically but is typically more efficient than fan power for the same added load removal (Q ≈ k_air*f + k_water*w).

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary rationale: All zones are too warm (28.3–28.6°C vs 26°C target) and cooling is occurring too slowly at the previous settings (−0.03 to −0.05°C/min). CO2 is low (493–583 ppm) and rising modestly, so minimum outdoor air is safe and preferred to minimize latent/sensible load. Per efficiency rules, we prioritize water-side capacity first, but the coil valve is already at its maximum. To increase sensible cooling, we therefore raise airflow while minimizing throttling losses by fully opening zone dampers. This allows lower static pressure for given flow and maximizes cooling effectiveness at the coil. We keep OA at minimum to reduce chiller load and maintain CO2 below limits. Increase fan speed from 0.7 to 1.0 to accelerate pull-down toward the 25–27°C comfort band, accepting the cubic power increase for a short interval because comfort is currently violated; we’ll be able to ramp down once temperatures approach setpoint.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 1.0}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

CO2 is low (581–696 ppm) and rising slowly; outdoor air is hot (31°C) and humid, so extra OA would increase cooling load. Previous actuation: all zone dampers 1.0 (fully open), OA 0.05 (min), coil_valve 1.0 (max water flow), fan_speed 0.95.
2) Predict 5-minute drift if we hold: Using current temp slopes (-0.06 to -0.07 °C/min), projected temps after 5 min are approximately Z1 27.6, Z2 27.15, Z3 27.4, Z4 27.8 — still out of band. CO2 will increase by ~44–53 ppm and remain well below 1000 ppm.
3) Strategy for comfort with minimal power: Keep OA at minimum (CO2 well below limit) to avoid added load. Water side is already maxed (coil_valve 1.0), and pumps are typically more efficient than fans, so the next lever is a modest fan increase to raise air-side heat transfer. Use static-pressure reset logic by keeping at least one damper at 1.0; apply slight throttling on cooler zones to bias more flow to the hottest zone while avoiding large throttling losses.
4) Actuator choices:
   - OA damper: hold at 0.05 (min) — CO2 safe, reduces chiller/coil load.
   - Coil valve: hold at 1.0 (max) — we still need more cooling capacity.
   - Fan speed: increase moderately from 0.95 to 1.10 to boost Q without incurring the large cubic power penalty of a bigger step. This should increase the cooling rate ~10–20% depending on the air-side share of Q.
   - Zone dampers: keep Zone 4 (hottest) at 1.0; slightly reduce Zones 1–3 to 0.95 to bias airflow to Zone 4 while keeping throttling minimal and maintaining one fully open damper for low static setpoint.
5) Constraint checks: All commands within bounds. Smooth changes applied (fan +0.15, small damper trims). CO2 projected < 800 ppm after 5 min, far below 1000/1050 ppm limits. Comfort is not likely fully recovered within this single interval but will trend toward the 25–27°C band while minimizing power versus a larger fan increase.
6) Next-step intent: If zones remain above 27°C next interval, consider a small additional fan increase; once zones enter 26–27°C, begin reducing fan (and then coil) to hold near 26°C.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.95, 0.95, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 1.1}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1 – Comfort status/trend: All zones are above the 26°C target but within/near the 25–27°C band. Current cooling rates are about −0.07 to −0.08 °C/min. Over 5 minutes at current settings, zones would land between ~26.3–26.95°C. We can safely reduce capacity and still remain within 25–27°C. Step 2 – Ventilation/CO2: CO2 levels (669–784 ppm) are well below 1000 ppm, rising ~8.4–8.7 ppm/min. Keep outdoor air at minimum; no ventilation-driven increase needed. Step 3 – Energy trade-off: To minimize P_total with Q ≈ k_air*f + k_water*w and cubic power, reduce fan more than water (pump-side is typically cheaper per unit load). We’ll modestly trim both to avoid oscillations while maintaining cooling. From (f=1.12, w=1.0) to (f=0.96, w=0.92) gives about an 11% load reduction (Q ratio ~1.88/2.12≈0.887), while cutting power substantially: P_fan 1.12^3→0.96^3 (≈1.405→0.884) and P_pump 1.0^3→0.92^3 (1.0→0.778). Rough combined normalized P_total drops from ~2.405 to ~1.662 (~31% savings). Step 4 – Static-pressure reset: Open VAV dampers to minimize throttling and allow lower static pressure/fan power. Keep at least one damper at 100%. We will keep Zones 1 and 4 at 1.0 and ease Zones 2 and 3 toward fully open. Step 5 – Predicted outcomes next 5 minutes: With ~11% less capacity, cooling rates scale to roughly 0.887× current rates: Z1 −0.07→−0.062°C/min (27.2→~26.89), Z2 −0.08→−0.071 (26.7→~26.34), Z3 −0.07→−0.062 (26.9→~26.59), Z4 −0.07→−0.062 (27.3→~26.99). All remain in 25–27°C band, trending toward 26°C. CO2 may rise slightly faster with lower total airflow, but remains far below 1000 ppm (projected ~710–835 ppm). Step 6 – OA: Keep at minimum (0.05) to reduce latent/sensible load and chiller work. Step 7 – Smoothness/safety: Changes are moderate and within bounds; at least one damper is fully open to support static pressure reset.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.98, 0.98, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.92, ""fan_speed"": 0.96}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Current comfort state and 5‑min forecast at prior settings (f=0.9, w=0.9):
   - Z1: 26.8C trending −0.04C/min → ~26.6C in 5 min (above 26 but within band).
   - Z2: 26.0C trending −0.06C/min → ~25.7C (cool side of target but in band).
   - Z3: 26.4C trending −0.05C/min → ~26.15C (near target).
   - Z4: 26.9C trending −0.04C/min → ~26.7C (near top of band but safe).
   All zones are within 25–27C and drifting slightly cooler than 26C.
2) CO2 status and forecast (OA at 0.05, current fan):
   - All zones 749–877 ppm, rising ~8–9 ppm/min. Over 5 min → +40–45 ppm; all stay < 1000 ppm. We can keep OA at minimum (0.05) to avoid humid/hot air load and chiller energy.
3) Energy trade-offs:
   - Fan power ~ f^3; Pump power ~ w^3. To minimize total power while maintaining comfort, prefer leaning on water flow (w) and reducing fan (f), keeping dampers wide open to minimize static losses.
   - Reducing fan from 0.9 to 0.8 cuts P_fan from 0.9^3=0.729 to 0.8^3=0.512 (~30% fan power savings) with a modest reduction in airflow capacity. Keeping coil valve high (w=0.9) preserves sensible capacity mainly via the coil, supporting comfort while outdoor temperature is hot and rising.
4) Damper strategy:
   - Keep all zone dampers at 1.0 to ensure at least one is fully open and minimize throttling/static pressure, enabling lower fan power for the same delivery.
5) Risk check with proposed changes (f=0.8, w=0.9):
   - Cooling rate will reduce slightly, which helps prevent Z2 from overcooling below 26 while keeping Z1/Z3/Z4 at or near 26 and Z4 below 27C (small margin preserved by keeping w high). OA remains minimal; CO2 expected to remain well < 1000 ppm even with slightly lower airflow.
6) Smoothness and bounds:
   - Changes are modest (fan 0.9→0.8). All commands within bounds; OA unchanged at minimum; coil unchanged for stability; dampers unchanged at 1.0.
Conclusion: Lower fan speed to save significant energy while relying on coil to maintain comfort; keep OA minimum; keep dampers fully open for static pressure reset.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.9, ""fan_speed"": 0.8}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of reasoning and actions: 1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1 and Z4 are at 26.5°C and trending down; Z3 is near setpoint; Z2 is slightly cool (25.6°C) and trending further down. To nudge zones toward 26°C with minimal energy, slightly reduce net cooling and bias less air to cooler zones. 2) CO2/Ventilation: Z1 CO2 is 967 ppm rising ~8.4 ppm/min, which would exceed 1000 ppm within the next interval if unchanged. To keep ≤1000 ppm with minimal energy, increase outdoor-air fraction modestly rather than significantly increasing fan speed (fan power is cubic). Raise OA damper from 0.05 to 0.065 and slightly reduce fan; net OA flow still increases (~27% vs previous), which should flatten Z1 CO2 well below 1000 ppm while minimizing OA. 3) Energy optimization: Reduce fan speed slightly (0.80→0.78) to cut fan power (cubic). Keep coil capacity high but slightly lower the valve (0.86→0.84) recognizing warmer mixed air from higher OA; this reduces pump/chiller use and should still maintain comfort given current cooling trends. 4) Dampers/static pressure: Keep at least one damper at 100% open (retain Z1 and Z4 at 1.0). Slightly throttle Z2 (0.8→0.75) and Z3 (0.9→0.85) to avoid overcooling and to bias more flow/ventilation to Z1 and Z4. 5) Smoothness: All changes are small to avoid oscillations and respect bounds.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.75, 0.85, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.065, ""coil_valve"": 0.84, ""fan_speed"": 0.78}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Assess current constraints and priorities.
- Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Zones 1 & 4 are slightly warm (26.2°C, cooling slowly). Zone 2 is a bit cool (25.3°C, flat). Zone 3 is slightly cool (25.7°C, slowly cooling).
- CO2: Zone 1 is the constraint at 1029 ppm but trending down −6.7 ppm/min. Others are ≤ 953 ppm and stable/decreasing. We must ensure Zone 1 drops below 1000 ppm within this interval and never exceeds 1050 ppm.
- Energy: OA air is hot/humid (32.3°C), so OA fraction drives coil/chiller load. Fan/pump cubic laws: small fan reductions yield notable savings; pump power is typically cheaper than fan. Maintain at least one zone damper at 100% open to minimize static pressure and fan power.

Step 2: Ventilation/CO2 strategy (minimize OA while ensuring Z1 CO2 compliance).
- With current OA=0.50 and fan=0.78, Z1 CO2 falls ~6.7 ppm/min; in 5 min → ~−33.5 ppm to ~995 ppm.
- We will slightly reduce OA to 0.48 and fan to 0.76. Approximate CO2 decay scales with (fan × OA × Z1 airflow share). Scaling from baseline: (0.76/0.78)×(0.48/0.50) ≈ 0.974×0.96 ≈ 0.935 → expected decay ≈ −6.7×0.935 ≈ −6.26 ppm/min. Over 5 min → ~−31.3 ppm, taking Z1 from 1029 to ~997.7 ppm (below 1000) with a small safety margin. Throttling Z2 and Z3 increases Z1’s relative share of total supply, likely improving this margin further.

Step 3: Airflow allocation via zone dampers (comfort + ventilation effectiveness).
- Keep Z1 damper at 1.0 to maximize its ventilation and satisfy the static-pressure reset rule (at least one damper at 100%). Keep Z4 at 1.0 as well to reduce throttling losses and help comfort (slightly warm).
- Throttle Z2 (cool) from 0.50 → 0.35 to reduce overcooling and unnecessary ventilation.
- Slightly reduce Z3 from 0.90 → 0.80 to ease overcooling and reduce ventilation there while keeping CO2 safely < 1000 ppm.

Step 4: Fan and coil balance for energy and comfort.
- Fan: Reduce from 0.78 → 0.76. Fan power drops from 0.78^3 ≈ 0.4746 to 0.76^3 ≈ 0.4390 (≈7.5% reduction). Lower total supply also reduces OA mass flow and chiller load.
- Coil valve: Hold at 0.82 to maintain sufficient sensible capacity as we reduce fan slightly and OA modestly. Zones 1 & 4 should continue cooling toward 26°C; Z2 & Z3 throttling addresses their slight overcooling. If temps trend too cool next interval, we can trim the coil; if too warm, we can increase coil before touching fan per guidance.

Step 5: Check constraints and smoothness.
- Comfort: Z1 & Z4 should continue gentle cooling toward 26°C; Z2 should warm slightly toward setpoint; Z3 should stabilize near 26°C. All remain within 25–27°C.
- CO2: Z1 expected ~997–999 ppm by the end of the interval; others remain well below 1000 ppm. Never near 1050 ppm.
- OA minimized cautiously (0.48) while ensuring CO2 compliance; smooth changes (small tweaks to OA/fan, moderate damper adjustments). Bounds respected and at least one damper at 100% open (Z1, plus Z4).

Conclusion: This action set reduces fan energy, trims OA to the minimum needed to bring Z1 under 1000 ppm this interval, uses dampers to prevent overcooling and improve ventilation distribution, and keeps coil steady for stability.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.35, 0.8, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.48, ""coil_valve"": 0.82, ""fan_speed"": 0.76}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort vs. setpoint band (25–27°C, target 26°C): Z1=26.1 (slightly high, slowly cooling), Z2=25.4 (cool, slowly warming), Z3=25.7 (slightly cool, very slowly cooling), Z4=26.2 (slightly high, slowly cooling). All within band; slight overcooling in Z2/Z3.
2) CO2: Z1=1002 ppm with -4.8 ppm/min (will fall to ~978 in 5 min at current conditions). Others 855–936 ppm with safe trends. We must not let any zone exceed 1050 and aim ≤1000. Since Z1 is just above 1000 but already decreasing, do not reduce ventilation yet; no need to increase OA either.
3) Power trade-offs: Fan and pump power scale ~cube of speed/valve. Outdoor air is hot/humid, so reducing OA lowers coil/chiller load. However, to ensure Z1 CO2 drops below 1000 promptly, hold OA this interval and look for power savings via small reductions to coil (pump) and a slight fan trim, keeping at least one damper at 100% open (static-pressure reset).
4) Strategy:
   - Keep OA damper steady at 0.48 until Z1 is below 1000, then we can ramp OA down next interval.
   - Reduce coil_valve modestly (0.82→0.78) to cut pump/chiller load; zones are at/near setpoint and slightly cooling, so less cooling is acceptable and moves Z2/Z3 toward 26°C.
   - Slightly reduce fan_speed (0.76→0.74) to save fan power while maintaining dilution; keep Z1 damper fully open to prioritize its ventilation for CO2.
   - Damper tuning to reduce throttling and overcooling: keep Z1 at 1.0 (priority for CO2 and static pressure reset), trim Z2 (0.35→0.30) and Z3 (0.80→0.75) to reduce overcooling there, and slightly back off Z4 (1.0→0.95) since it is a bit above 26 but stable.
5) Constraint checks: All actuators within bounds; at least one damper (Z1) at 100%; OA not increased; changes are smooth.

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Assess comfort vs. setpoint band (25–27°C, target 26°C): Z1=26.1 (slightly high, slowly cooling), Z2=25.4 (cool, slowly warming), Z3=25.7 (slightly cool, very slowly cooling), Z4=26.2 (slightly high, slowly cooling). All within band; slight overcooling in Z2/Z3.\n2) CO2: Z1=1002 ppm with -4.8 ppm/min (will fall to ~978 in 5 min at current conditions). Others 855–936 ppm with safe trends. We must not let any zone exceed 1050 and aim ≤1000. Since Z1 is just above 1000 but already decreasing, do not reduce ventilation yet; no need to increase OA either.\n3) Power trade-offs: Fan and pump power scale ~cube of speed/valve. Outdoor air is hot/humid, so reducing OA lowers coil/chiller load. However, to ensure Z1 CO2 drops below 1000 promptly, hold OA this interval and look for power savings via small reductions to coil (pump) and a slight fan trim, keeping at least one damper at 100% open (static-pressure reset).\n4) Strategy:\n   - Keep OA damper steady at 0.48 until Z1 is below 1000, then we can ramp OA down next interval.\n   - Reduce coil_valve modestly (0.82→0.78) to cut pump/chiller load; zones are at/near setpoint and slightly cooling, so less cooling is acceptable and moves Z2/Z3 toward 26°C.\n   - Slightly reduce fan_speed (0.76→0.74) to save fan power while maintaining dilution; keep Z1 damper fully open to prioritize its ventilation for CO2.\n   - Damper tuning to reduce throttling and overcooling: keep Z1 at 1.0 (priority for CO2 and static pressure reset), trim Z2 (0.35→0.30) and Z3 (0.80→0.75) to reduce overcooling there, and slightly back off Z4 (1.0→0.95) since it is a bit above 26 but stable.\n5) Constraint checks: All actuators within bounds; at least one damper (Z1) at 100%; OA not increased; changes are smooth. Predicted outcomes next 5 minutes: Z1 CO2 drops below 1000 while staying well under 1050, temperatures remain within 25–27°C with Z2/Z3 drifting toward 26, and total power reduced via cubic savings on both fan and pump.\n6) Next-step intent (not executed now): If Z1 CO2 < 980 next interval, begin stepping OA down (e.g., -0.03 to -0.05 per step) while watching CO2 slopes; continue trimming coil/fan as loads allow."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. Z1=26.1 (slightly high, trending down), Z4=26.1 (slightly high, trending down), Z2=25.5 (slightly cool, trending up), Z3=25.7 (slightly cool, stable). Minor steering is sufficient.
2) CO2/ventilation: All zones are <1000 ppm (Z1=983 falling, Z2=921 slowly rising, Z3=924 falling, Z4=834 falling). Per rule, keep OA at minimum unless needed; given ample margin and short 5-min horizon, we can safely reduce OA to minimum while monitoring Z2 next interval.
3) Outdoor conditions: 32.8°C and humid. Reducing OA cuts latent and sensible load, reducing chiller/coil energy. This allows us to also reduce coil and fan to save power.
4) Energy strategy and trade-offs: Power ~ cubic with speed/flow. To avoid high fan power, primarily trim coil_valve (pump is typically cheaper than fan) and then reduce fan moderately. Static-pressure reset: keep at least one damper at 100% open to lower required static pressure.
5) Damper adjustments by zone: 
- Keep Z1 at 1.0 (reference wide-open) to satisfy static-pressure reset and help a slightly warm zone.
- Open Z4 to 1.0 (from 0.95) as it’s slightly warm and to further reduce throttling.
- Slightly reduce Z2 damper from 0.30 to 0.25 to let it warm toward 26 (it’s 25.5 and rising slowly).
- Nudge Z3 from 0.75 to 0.65 to drift it toward 26 (currently 25.7).
6) OA damper: Reduce from 0.48 to minimum 0.05 to minimize outdoor air load while CO2 remains comfortably below limits.
7) Coil and fan: With OA minimized, total load drops. Reduce coil_valve and fan_speed smoothly to avoid oscillations and maintain comfort, prioritizing coil first and then fan. Choose coil_valve ≈ 0.66 (down from 0.78) and fan_speed ≈ 0.68 (down from 0.74). Expected effects: lower P_pump and P_fan (cubic savings), maintain comfort given reduced OA load, and prevent overcooling of the cooler zones via damper reductions.
8) Safety checks: 
- Comfort: With reduced cooling to Z2/Z3 and full-open for Z1/Z4, all zones should stay near 26 within 25–27°C.
- CO2: Even if CO2 rise accelerates with OA at minimum, short-term increase should keep all zones <1000 ppm and well below the hard limit 1050 ppm; monitor Z2 next interval.
- Bounds: All actuators within provided limits.
9) Power outcome (qualitative): P_fan ~ 0.68^3 ≈ 0.314 (vs 0.74^3 ≈ 0.405), P_pump ~ 0.66^3 ≈ 0.287 (vs 0.78^3 ≈ 0.474). OA reduction further reduces coil/chiller load.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.25, 0.65, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.66, ""fan_speed"": 0.68}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Key constraints: keep all zones 25–27°C (target 26°C) and CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never >1050 ppm). Current risks: Zone 1 (1075 ppm) and Zone 3 (1002 ppm) are over the 1000 ppm comfort threshold, with positive CO2 trends; Zone 2 (991 ppm) is rising and will exceed 1000 ppm soon. Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.8°C), so more OA raises cooling load. Strategy: 1) Immediately increase ventilation to arrest and reverse CO2 rise, prioritizing OA fraction and opening dampers to high-CO2 zones; 2) Keep at least one zone damper fully open to minimize static pressure; 3) Use only a modest fan increase (cubic power penalty) and adjust zone dampers to target ventilation where needed; 4) Open coil moderately to offset added OA heat and keep zone temps near 26°C without overcooling. Actions chosen: - Raise OA damper to 0.55 (≈3× baseline OA flow when combined with fan change) to promptly drive down CO2 while not maxing OA. - Slightly increase fan to 0.78 to boost total ventilation; rely primarily on OA fraction and damper allocation to high-CO2 zones (Z1, Z3 at 1.0; Z2 increased; Z4 reduced) so at least one damper is 100% open and throttling is minimized. - Coil valve to 0.80 to counteract warmer mixed air and hold comfort without excessive pump/chiller energy. Expectation: CO2 in Z1/Z3 should move downward promptly; Z2 should remain below 1000 ppm. Temperatures should stay within band and near 26°C.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of reasoning and decisions:
- IAQ/CO2: Zone 1 is at 1027 ppm and rising ~7.8 ppm/min, which would exceed 1050 ppm within 5 minutes if unchanged. To prevent this and drive CO2 back toward ≤1000 ppm, increase outdoor-air fraction significantly. Prefer raising OA over fan speed to avoid cubic fan power penalties.
- Energy trade-offs: Keep fan speed at 0.7 (minimise P_fan). Compensate added thermal/latent load from higher OA with a modest coil valve increase; water-side power is typically cheaper than fan power, and colder supply air helps maintain comfort.
- Temperature control: Zones 2 and 3 are slightly cool; slightly throttle their dampers to let them warm toward 26°C. Zone 4 is slightly warm; open its damper fully to increase cooling delivery. Maintain Zone 1 at 100% open to satisfy static-pressure reset (at least one damper fully open) and reduce throttling losses.
- Smoothness and limits: Changes are moderate except OA (made larger to satisfy IAQ constraints). All actuator values are within bounds; avoid oscillations and reassess next interval.
Expected effects next 5 min:
- CO2: Higher OA fraction should flatten or reverse Zone 1 CO2 rise and keep all zones well below 1050 ppm while trending toward 1000 ppm.
- Comfort: Coil valve bump offsets warmer/humid OA; damper tweaks nudge Zones 2–3 slightly warmer, and extra flow to Zone 4 assists slight cooling. Fan speed unchanged to save power.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.4, 0.65, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.79, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Trends are small: Z1 26.0 (+0.01 C/min), Z2 25.9 (+0.02), Z3 25.7 (+0.01), Z4 26.2 (flat). No urgent thermal correction needed. 2) CO2/Ventilation check: Z1 is at 1026 ppm (>1000 target, below 1050 hard limit) and slowly decreasing (-0.4 ppm/min). Z2 (956, +0.6), Z3 (962, +0.7) are rising but under 1000. Z4 is low (875, falling).

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Comfort assessment: All zones are within 25–27°C. Targets: Z1=26.0 (OK), Z2=26.0 (OK), Z3=25.7 (a bit cool), Z4=26.2 (slightly warm). Aim to keep close to 26°C by shifting some air from cooler zones to warmer ones.
2) CO2/ventilation: Z1 is 1017 ppm (>1000) but trending down (-1.6 ppm/min). Others are ≤1000 and also trending down. We need to accelerate Z1 dilution while minimizing outdoor air. Best levers: keep Z1 damper fully open (already 1.0), modestly throttle cooler/neutral zones (Z2, Z3) to reallocate flow to Z1, and slightly increase OA fraction to boost dilution. Avoid large fan increases (cubic power penalty).
3) Power trade-offs: Fan power ~ f^3 and pump/coil ~ w^3; increasing water-side (coil_valve) is generally cheaper than fan for the same load. Raising OA increases coil/chiller load, so keep the OA increment modest and use coil valve to hold supply air temperature. Keep at least one zone damper at 100% to minimize static pressure requirement.
4) Control moves chosen:
   - Zone dampers: Keep Z1 at 1.0 to be the control/critical zone; slightly reduce Z2 and Z3 to shift flow and let Z3 warm toward 26°C; slightly increase Z4 to cool it toward 26°C.
   - OA damper: Increase from 0.40 to 0.55 (modest step) to hasten CO2 reduction in Z1 while avoiding an excessive energy penalty.
   - Fan speed: Hold at 0.75 to avoid cubic power increase and rely on reallocation + OA for CO2; this also avoids oscillations.
   - Coil valve: Increase slightly (0.81 → 0.86) to offset the warmer mixed air from higher OA and keep zone temps near 26°C. This follows the guidance to use water-side first before fan.
5) Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes:
   - CO2: With OA up to 0.55 and more flow share to Z1 (Z1 damper 100%, Z2/Z3 throttled), Z1’s dilution rate should increase materially; projected drop brings it close to ~1004 ppm in 5 minutes and trending below 1000 shortly after, while staying well below the 1050 ppm hard limit.
   - Temperatures: Z3 should drift slightly warmer toward 26°C; Z4 should cool slightly; Z1 and Z2 should remain near 26°C. All zones stay within 25–27°C.
6) Constraints and smoothness: All actuators within bounds; minimal, smooth changes; at least one zone damper at 100% maintained for static-pressure reset.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.55, ""coil_valve"": 0.86, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Aim to keep close to 26°C by shifting some air from cooler zones to warmer ones.\n2) CO2/ventilation: Z1 is 1017 ppm (>1000) but trending down (-1.6 ppm/min). Others are ≤1000 and also trending down. We need to accelerate Z1 dilution while minimizing outdoor air. Best levers: keep Z1 damper fully open (already 1.0), modestly throttle cooler/neutral zones (Z2, Z3) to reallocate flow to Z1, and slightly increase OA fraction to boost dilution. Avoid large fan increases (cubic power penalty).\n3) Power trade-offs: Fan power ~ f^3 and pump/coil ~ w^3; increasing water-side (coil_valve) is generally cheaper than fan for the same load. Raising OA increases coil/chiller load, so keep the OA increment modest and use coil valve to hold supply air temperature.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone 4 is slightly warm (26.2°C, flat trend). Zones 1–3 are at/near 26°C with very small trends (±0.01°C/min), so only minor adjustments are needed. 2) CO2/ventilation: All zones are <1000 ppm and trending downward with OA damper at 0.55. To minimize energy, reduce OA. However, Zone 1 is at 979 ppm, so stepping OA all the way to minimum could risk a short-term rebound. Make a substantial but not extreme reduction to 0.15 to maintain margin while cutting load; re-evaluate next interval. 3) Load/energy strategy: With hot outdoor air (33.3°C), reducing OA decreases mixed-air temperature/enthalpy and coil load. This allows reducing coil valve (pump) and fan speed while maintaining comfort. Given cubic power scaling, we target modest reductions in both, with the preference to use water-side capacity for load handling when needed and avoid large fan increases. 4) Fan/static pressure: Keep at least one zone damper at 100% open to minimize throttling and static pressure needs; hold Zone 1 damper at 1.0. Slightly open Zone 4 (the warmest) to ensure it gets adequate flow despite a small fan speed reduction. Nudge Zone 2 slightly open to hedge against any warming; leave Zone 3 unchanged. 5) Chosen adjustments: - OA damper: 0.55 → 0.15 (large reduction to cut OA load while preserving CO2 margin). - Coil valve: 0.86 → 0.78 (lower pump/chiller load enabled by reduced OA). - Fan speed: 0.75 → 0.70 (cubic fan power savings while dampers adjustments preserve comfort). - Zone dampers: keep Z1=1.0 (static-pressure reset logic), Z4: 0.8 → 0.85 to cool slightly warm zone, Z2: 0.4 → 0.45 slight hedge, Z3: hold at 0.5. 6) Constraints/risks: All actuators within bounds.

Trends over next 5 min (approx.): Z1 25.9→25.85, Z2 26.1→26.15, Z3 25.9→26.0, Z4 26.2→26.15. Temperatures look stable. CO2: Z1=1018 ppm rising ~7.6 ppm/min would reach ~1056 ppm in 5 min (violates 1050 cap). Z3=996 ppm rising ~9.3 ppm/min would reach ~1043 ppm (>1000). Z2=972 ppm rising ~7.6 ppm/min would reach ~1010 ppm (>1000). Z4=872 ppm safe. 2) Control priorities: Prevent any CO2 >1050 (hard cap) and aim ≤1000 while minimizing OA and power. 3) Strategy: a) Increase OA fraction just enough to keep Z1 <1050 and reduce rises in Z2/Z3; b) Rebalance zone dampers to deliver more supply (and thus more OA) to the high-CO2 zones (Z1, Z3, and a bit to Z2) while trimming Z4; c) Keep at least one damper at 100% (static pressure reset) to minimize fan power; d) Avoid fan speed increases (cubic penalty) and avoid large actuator swings; e) Keep coil valve roughly steady since temperatures are on target; adjust later if temps drift. 4) OA choice: From 0.15 to 0.20 (~33% more OA) should cut CO2 rise rates roughly proportionally and, combined with damper redistribution, keep Z1 under 1050 and pull Z2/Z3 closer to or below 1000. This is a minimal-moderate step to satisfy the hard constraint without excessive energy. 5) Zone dampers: Keep Z1 at 1.0 (ensures at least one fully open and prioritizes fresh air to the highest CO2 zone). Open Z3 from 0.50→0.75 to address its rising CO2 and slight warming. Open Z2 from 0.45→0.55 to mitigate its CO2 rise. Trim Z4 from 0.85→0.60 (lowest CO2, slightly cooling) to shift flow to others and reduce unnecessary OA to Z4. 6) Fan speed: Hold at 0.70 to avoid cubic fan power increase while the static-pressure reset (Z1=100%) minimizes throttling losses. 7) Coil valve: Keep at 0.78 for now; increased OA adds load, but damper redistribution and current temps near setpoint suggest we can hold water flow this interval and reassess; this avoids extra pump power. 8) Bounds and smoothness: All moves within bounds, moderate step sizes to avoid oscillations. Expectation: CO2 in Z1 stays below 1050 and trends toward ≤1000; Z2/Z3 near or below 1000; temps remain within band and near 26°C.

Expectation: CO2 in Z1 stays below 1050 and trends toward ≤1000; Z2/Z3 near or below 1000; temps remain within band and near 26°C. Will incrementally adjust OA or coil next interval if CO2/temps indicate."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Assessment: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. However, CO2 is critical: Z1=1047 ppm, Z2=1002 ppm, Z3=1029 ppm, all rising ~5–6 ppm/min, which would exceed 1050 ppm within one interval if unchanged. Strategy: Increase outdoor air to immediately reverse CO2 rise while minimizing electrical power. Avoid increasing fan speed due to cubic power penalty; prefer opening zone dampers (reduces throttling/static pressure needs) and use coil valve (water-side) to handle extra sensible/latent load from hotter, more humid OA. Keep at least one zone damper at 100% open. Actions: Raise OA damper substantially (0.55) to purge CO2; keep fan speed at 0.70; increase coil valve moderately (0.86) to maintain comfort with higher OA enthalpy; keep Z1 damper at 1.0 for static pressure reset and open Z2/Z3/Z4 dampers slightly to improve comfort and dilution without raising fan speed. Expected outcome in next 5 minutes: CO2 slopes turn negative and stay below 1050 ppm, temps remain within band near 26°C.

Actions: Slightly reduce outdoor-air damper to cut latent/sensible load while keeping CO2 trending down, keep fan speed steady to preserve ventilation flow, slightly increase coil valve to hold temps as OA is reduced, and open Zone 2/3 dampers modestly to direct cooling to the slightly warm zones; keep Zones 1 and 4 at 100% to satisfy static-pressure reset.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.

Small upward drift (+0.00 to +0.01°C/min) suggests we must not reduce cooling; increased OA will add heat, so offset with coil rather than fan to save power. Step 2 – Check CO2/ventilation risk: Z1=1035 ppm (rising), Z3=1031 ppm (rising); both would exceed 1050 ppm within 5–10 minutes if we make no change. Z2=992 ppm (rising) risks crossing 1000 ppm. OA must be increased immediately and air biased toward high-CO2 zones. Step 3 – Energy strategy: Use coil (water-side) first since pump power is typically cheaper than fan power; avoid fan increases due to cubic penalty. Increase OA fraction (needed for CO2 compliance) while keeping total airflow modest; redistribute via dampers, and keep at least one damper at 100% open for static-pressure reset. Step 4 – Set actuators: (a) Raise OA damper from 0.20 to 0.38 to quickly dilute CO2 across all zones. (b) Keep Z1 and Z3 dampers at 1.0 (fully open) to minimize throttling losses and prioritize flow to high-CO2 zones. (c) Slightly open Z2 damper to 0.85 to prevent it from exceeding 1000 ppm. (d) Throttle Z4 to 0.78 to bias more flow to the higher-CO2 zones while still maintaining comfort (Z4 is at 26.2°C). (e) Keep fan speed at 0.60 to avoid cubic fan power increase. (f) Increase coil valve to 1.00 to offset added OA heat and hold temps near 26°C. Step 5 – Expected results: CO2 in Z1/Z3 should reverse or at least stop rising and remain ≤1050 ppm, with Z2 stabilized ≤1000 ppm. Temperatures should remain within band near 26°C. Energy use is minimized by avoiding fan increase, using water-side capacity, minimizing throttling via fully open dampers, and using only as much OA as needed.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Comfort status and trends:
- All zones are within 25–27°C, but Zone 2/3/4 are slightly warm at 26.3°C with a small upward trend (~+0.01°C/min). Coil valve is already at 1.0 (max), so additional cooling should come primarily from airflow (fan) rather than water.
2) CO2 risk assessment for next 5 min (must stay ≤1000 ppm; never exceed 1050 ppm):
- Zone 1: 1045 ppm rising 1.9 ppm/min → +9.5 ppm projected → ~1054.5 ppm (violates 1050), immediate action required.
- Zone 3: 1040 ppm rising 1.6 ppm/min → ~1048 ppm (close to 1050), needs more ventilation.
- Zone 2: 996 ppm rising 0.9 ppm/min → ~1000.5 ppm (slightly above 1000), needs a small increase in ventilation.
- Zone 4: 873 ppm safe.
3) Control strategy priorities:
- Increase outdoor air just enough to arrest CO2 rises while minimizing OA due to hot/humid OA (33°C, high AH), which increases cooling load.
- Since coil_valve is maxed, modestly increase fan_speed to boost coil heat transfer (k_air · f) and distribute more OA, but avoid large fan jumps (cubic power).
- Reallocate airflow by damper: keep at least one damper fully open (static-pressure reset) and throttle low-CO2 zones to bias ventilation toward high-CO2 zones without a large OA increase.
4) Selected adjustments and rationale:
- OA damper: increase from 0.38 → 0.50 (≈+32% OA fraction). This directly improves ventilation to all zones.
- Fan speed: increase from 0.60 → 0.64 (~+6.7% flow). Fan power impact ≈ (0.64/0.60)^3 ≈ 1.23 (≈+23%), a moderate increase to boost both cooling and ventilation.
- Zone dampers: keep Zone 1 and Zone 3 at 1.0 (they have highest CO2) to ensure at least one 100% open damper and to bias flow. Slightly throttle Zone 2 (0.85 → 0.80) and more on Zone 4 (0.78 → 0.60) to divert supply (including OA share) to Zones 1 and 3. This reduces the needed OA increase system-wide.
5) Expected outcomes:
- CO2: Combined effect (↑OA fraction, ↑flow, and allocation to Zones 1 & 3) should reverse the upward CO2 trend in Zone 1, keep Zone 3 well below 1050, and keep Zone 2 ≤1000.
- Temperature: OA increase slightly warms mixed air, but higher fan flow improves coil heat transfer; net effect should keep all zones within 25–27°C, likely still near 26.2–26.4°C short-term.
- Energy: Pump already maxed; small fan increase is chosen as the lowest feasible increment to meet CO2 while avoiding a larger OA increase. Static-pressure logic satisfied (two zones at 100%), minimizing throttling losses.
6) Smoothness and bounds: All changes are moderate, within bounds, and designed to avoid oscillations; will reassess in 5 minutes and tighten OA back down if CO2 margins improve.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.8, 1.0, 0.6], ""oa_damper"": 0.5, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.64}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of conditions: All zones are within 25–27°C but drifting slightly warmer (+0.01°C/min). Z1 and Z3 CO2 are just above 1000 ppm but trending down at ~2 ppm/min with current OA/fan. Outdoor air is hot and humid, so excess OA penalizes coil/chiller. Coil valve already at 1.0 (max water flow), so use airside carefully; prefer opening dampers to reduce throttling and keep fan moderate. Decisions: 1) Keep coil_valve at 1.0 to hold/correct slight temperature rise. 2) Slightly reduce OA damper (0.48→0.46) to cut latent/sensible load while keeping Z1/Z3 CO2 trending downward; safety check: even with a small OA reduction and slight fan reduction, projected CO2 drops over 5 min still bring Z1/Z3 below 1000 ppm. 3) Open warm-zone dampers more to lower static pressure need and improve delivery without large fan increases: keep Z1 and Z3 at 1.0; increase Z2 (0.8→0.95); slightly trim Z4 (0.95→0.90) since its CO2 is low; at least one (actually two) dampers remain 100% open for static reset. 4) Nudge fan down slightly (0.68→0.66) to save cubic fan power, relying on more-open dampers and slightly colder mixed air (from reduced OA) to maintain comfort and CO2 trajectory. Expected outcomes over next 5 min: Z1/Z3 CO2 fall below 1000 ppm; temperatures hold or drift slightly toward 26°C; total power reduced via lower OA and fan while pump remains at max.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C but slightly warm (26.3–26.6°C) with flat-to-rising trends. Additional sensible cooling is needed to prevent drift above 27°C. The coil valve is already at 1.0, so we should avoid lowering water flow; increasing air-side flow is the available lever. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is 1013 ppm (above 1000) and trending up (+1.5 ppm/min). Zone 2 is 969 ppm trending up (+3.4 ppm/min). Zone 3 is 998 ppm trending down. Zone 4 is 834 ppm. We must reduce Z1 below 1000 without exceeding 1050. Raising outdoor air fraction would add significant heat/moisture with 34.2°C/very humid OA and the coil is maxed, so prefer increasing total and redistributed supply air to Z1 over increasing OA%. 3) Energy trade-offs: With coil_valve at 1.0 (water-side power already incurred), prefer using water rather than fan; but since we cannot increase water further, use a modest fan increase. Fan power is cubic, so keep the increase small and gain efficiency by keeping at least one damper 100% open to reduce static pressure needs. 4) Damper strategy: Keep Z1 at 100% open (it is CO2- and cooling-critical). Open Z2 to 100% to help its rising CO2 and temperature while maintaining a low required static pressure. Slightly trim Z3 and more aggressively trim Z4 (lowest CO2, acceptable temp) to bias available flow toward Z1 and Z2. This keeps at least one (actually two) dampers fully open to minimize throttling losses. 5) Outdoor air: Hold OA damper at 0.40 to avoid increasing latent/sensible load while the coil is at maximum. Increased airflow and redistribution should provide additional OA delivery to Z1 without increasing OA fraction. 6) Fan: Increase modestly from 0.68 to 0.71 (~+4.4% speed; fan power ~0.68^3=0.314 to 0.71^3≈0.358, ~+14% fan power) to boost total supply and ventilation. Pump remains at 1.0 (already cheaper than fan and needed for capacity). 7) Expected outcomes over next 5 min: More supply directed to Z1 and Z2 should reverse Z1’s CO2 slope and slow Z2’s rise without raising OA%. Temperatures should drift closer to 26°C or at least arrest upward drift, staying within comfort band. Changes are smooth and within bounds.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.75], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.71}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

We need a modest increase in net cooling to bring them closer to 26°C.
2) Ventilation/CO2: Max CO2 is 985 ppm (Zone 1), others 804–961 ppm. With OA at 45%, Z1 is slightly decreasing and Z2 slightly increasing. We can reduce OA to cut coil/chiller load while keeping CO2 safely <1000 ppm over the next 5 minutes.
3) Energy trade-offs: Pump (coil_valve) is already at 1.0; per guidance, water-side is cheaper than fan-side, but we’re at the upper limit. To increase effective cooling without raising fan power, reduce outdoor air (hot 34°C) to lower mixed-air temperature and coil load. Avoid fan increases due to cubic power scaling.
4) Static-pressure logic: Keep at least one damper at 100% open to minimize throttling. We already have three zones (1–3) at 100%, so SP requirement is minimized.
5) Actuator strategy:
   - OA damper: Reduce substantially to minimize load while maintaining CO2 margin. Move from 0.45 to 0.10 (smooth enough and maintains ample CO2 headroom for a 5-min horizon).
   - Coil valve: Keep at 1.0 to pull zones down toward 26°C; we will back off once zones approach target.
   - Fan speed: Hold at 0.70 (unchanged) to avoid cubic power penalty and oscillations; OA reduction will itself increase delivered cooling (colder supply) at the same airflow.
   - Zone dampers: Keep Zones 1–3 at 1.0 (fully open). Nudge Zone 4 from 0.65 to 0.70 since it’s slightly warm (26.5°C), but avoid opening all to 1.0 unnecessarily; we already satisfy the ‘at least one wide open’ rule and limit abrupt redistribution.
6) Expected outcomes next 5 minutes: Supply air gets colder due to lower OA fraction, increasing sensible cooling without extra fan power. Zone temps should drift down toward 26°C. CO2 should remain below 1000 ppm given current levels and short horizon; we will recheck and adjust OA if any zone trends toward the limit.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess state: All zones are within 25–27°C but slightly warm (26.3–26.6°C). Coil valve already at 1.0, so additional sensible/latent capacity via water is maxed. CO2 is the constraint driver: Z1=1048 ppm and rising (~+1 ppm/min) is near the 1050 hard cap; Z2=1022 ppm (+1.7/min), Z3=1006 ppm (+0.9/min), Z4=866 ppm. Outdoor air is very hot and humid (35.1°C, high AH), so increasing OA fraction increases chiller/coil load. 2) Control strategy: - Ventilation/CO2: Increase total OA flow just enough to halt/reverse CO2 rise, prioritizing delivery to high-CO2 zones via damper distribution. Prefer modest OA fraction increase plus a small fan increase (raises OA flow with less chiller penalty than a large OA fraction jump), and throttle the low-CO2 zone to direct flow to critical zones. - Cooling/power: With coil at 1.0 (cheaper than fan for added load but already maxed), use a modest fan increase to add sensible capacity (Q ≈ k_air*f + k_water*w) while keeping at least one zone damper fully open to minimize static pressure. Avoid large fan changes due to cubic power. Keep OA near-minimum consistent with CO2 control to limit chiller load. 3) Setpoints chosen: - Zone dampers: Keep Z1–Z3 at 1.0 to minimize throttling and maximize flow/ventilation where CO2 is high; reduce Z4 (low CO2) to 0.30 to redirect flow. - OA damper: Bump from 0.30 to 0.36 (moderate increase) to raise OA fraction without excessive latent penalty. - Fan speed: Raise from 0.80 to 0.84 (≈16% fan power increase) to boost both cooling delivery and OA flow. - Coil valve: Hold at 1.00 to keep supply air as cold/dry as possible given hot/humid OA. 4) Expected outcomes next 5 min: - OA flow increases ≈26% vs prior (OA_frac*flow: 0.36*0.84 vs 0.30*0.80), which should stop Z1’s CO2 rise and begin a slight decrease; Z2 and Z3 trends should also improve toward ≤1000 ppm over subsequent intervals. All zones remain well below 1050 ppm. - Temperatures should edge closer to 26°C due to higher airflow and full coil; Z4 may warm slightly but stays within band. 5) Smoothness/constraints: All actuators within bounds; at least one damper (three) at 100% to support static-pressure reset; changes are moderate to avoid oscillations.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.3], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.84}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Two zones have CO2 above the 1000 ppm target (Z1=1024, Z2=1008) but well below the hard limit 1050 ppm and trending downward. Outdoor air is very hot and humid (35.1°C, AH=0.0197), so extra OA is costly. Coil valve is already at 1.0 (max), fan at 0.84, OA damper at 0.36. 2) Objectives and trade-offs: We need to reduce CO2 to ≤1000 ppm while minimizing OA intake and total power. Because the coil is maxed, adding cooling is best via modest fan increases (air-side term), but fan power is cubic, so changes should be small. Increasing OA fraction raises OA cfm without raising total flow (more efficient than raising fan just to raise OA cfm), but also increases chiller/coil load. 3) CO2 control: With current OA (0.36) and trends (-1.5 and -1.1 ppm/min), Z1/Z2 will likely remain slightly >1000 ppm after 5 minutes. Getting them below 1000 within one interval would require impractically large OA and/or fan increases (hurting energy and potentially comfort). Strategy: modest OA increase to accelerate dilution while staying energy-aware; keep well below 1050 ppm and push toward 1000 over successive intervals. 4) Thermal control: Since zones are a bit warm and coil is at 1.0, use a slight fan increase to add some sensible capacity via airflow. Prioritize wide-open critical dampers to keep static pressure low. 5) Damper allocation: Keep Z1 and Z2 at 100% to (a) prioritize ventilation to the CO2-challenged zones, and (b) maintain at least one damper fully open for static-pressure reset (reducing required fan head). Gently increase Z4 damper (warmest zone) to improve cooling there. Hold Z3 steady to avoid oscillation. 6) OA setpoint: Increase OA damper slightly (0.36→0.42) to raise OA cfm ~17–18% (with a tiny fan bump), which expedites CO2 reduction without an excessive energy penalty. 7) Fan setpoint: Small increase (0.84→0.86) to add air-side cooling; fan power penalty ≈ [(0.86/0.84)^3] ≈ +7%. Pump stays at max; avoid larger fan jumps due to cubic scaling. 8) Smoothness and bounds: All changes are moderate, within bounds, and avoid oscillations. Expectation: CO2 continues to decline (though may still be slightly >1000 after 5 min), temps nudge closer to 26°C. Reassess next interval and trim OA back once all zones are ≤1000 ppm.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.65], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.86}","{

Increasing OA fraction raises OA cfm without raising total flow (more efficient than raising fan just to raise OA cfm), but also increases chiller/coil load. 3) CO2 control: With current OA (0.36) and trends (-1.5 and -1.1 ppm/min), Z1/Z2 will likely remain slightly >1000 ppm after 5 minutes. Getting them below 1000 within one interval would require impractically large OA and/or fan increases (hurting energy and potentially comfort). Strategy: modest OA increase to accelerate dilution while staying energy-aware; keep well below 1050 ppm and push toward 1000 over successive intervals. 4) Thermal control: Since zones are a bit warm and coil is at 1.0, use a slight fan increase to add some sensible capacity via airflow. Prioritize wide-open critical dampers to keep static pressure low. 5) Damper allocation: Keep Z1 and Z2 at 100% to (a) prioritize ventilation to the CO2-challenged zones, and (b) maintain at least one damper fully open for static-pressure reset (reducing required fan head). Gently increase Z4 damper (warmest zone) to improve cooling there. Hold Z3 steady to avoid oscillation. 6) OA setpoint: Increase OA damper slightly (0.36→0.42) to raise OA cfm ~17–18% (with a tiny fan bump), which expedites CO2 reduction without an excessive energy penalty. 7) Fan setpoint: Small increase (0.84→0.86) to add air-side cooling; fan power penalty ≈ [(0.86/0.84)^3] ≈ +7%. Pump stays at max; avoid larger fan jumps due to cubic scaling. 8) Smoothness and bounds: All changes are moderate, within bounds, and avoid oscillations. Expectation: CO2 continues to decline (though may still be slightly >1000 after 5 min), temps nudge closer to 26°C. Reassess next interval and trim OA back once all zones are ≤1000 ppm."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Comfort status. All zones are within 25–27°C but slightly warm relative to the 26°C target: Z1 26.2, Z2 26.5, Z3 26.4, Z4 26.5. Temperature trends are ~flat to slightly cooling; coil valve is already at its maximum (1.0), so additional sensible capacity from water-side is unavailable.
Step 2: CO2/ventilation. Z1 CO2 is 1003 ppm (slightly above 1000) with a negative trend (-3.7 ppm/min) at current OA damper 0.42; others are ≤ 990 ppm and also trending down. Reducing OA now risks reversing the trend and keeping Z1 above 1000; increasing OA would increase latent/sensible load with 35°C, humid OA, which is undesirable with coil maxed. Therefore, hold OA to maintain downward CO2 trend until all zones are ≤1000 ppm.
Step 3: Power and actuator priorities. With water-side at max and fan power cubic with speed, avoid increasing fan unless needed. Improve distribution by damper adjustments to reduce throttling and favor warmer zones. Keep at least one damper at 100% to support lower static pressure requirement.
Step 4: Damper strategy. Maintain Z1 at 100% to maximize its ventilation and cooling (it’s the CO2-limiting zone). Keep Z2 at 100% (also slightly warm). Slightly open Z4 (warmest and most restricted previously) to increase flow. Keep Z3 at 0.9 (already moderately warm) to avoid starving others but still allow some flow.
Step 5: Fan and coil. Keep fan speed at 0.86 to avoid ~15% power increase that a bump to 0.90 would cause, since zones are already within comfort band. Keep coil at 1.0 (max) given high outdoor load.
Step 6: OA damper. Hold at 0.42 to continue driving Z1 CO2 downward to ≤1000 while avoiding extra load from higher OA and avoiding a reversal of CO2 trend from lowering OA.
Expected outcome over next 5 minutes: Z1 CO2 should drop to ~985 ppm, others remain comfortably below 1000. Temperature should hold or drift slightly down in Z4 due to increased damper, with minimal impact on others. Power is minimized by avoiding fan increases and using distribution first while keeping at least one damper at 100%.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.86}","{

Z2 is the warmest; Z1 is close to target. We will keep more airflow to Z2 and avoid starving Z1. Slight trims to Z3/Z4 dampers are acceptable to reduce throttling losses while keeping at least one zone damper fully open for static-pressure reset. 
Step 2 – CO2/ventilation: CO2 is 836–989 ppm and trending down in all zones; Z1 is highest at 989 ppm. We should reduce outdoor air to cut load/power, but not so much that Z1 exceeds 1000 ppm. To avoid a sharp drop in OA delivery (and potential reversal of CO2 trend), we reduce OA damper moderately and keep Z1 damper at 100% to prioritize its ventilation. 
Step 3 – Power trade-offs: Reduce OA to lower coil/chiller load. Prefer water-side capacity over fan for efficiency, but coil is currently maxed. Because reducing OA lowers load, we can modestly lower both fan speed and coil valve while maintaining capacity near target: Q ≈ k_air*f + k_water*w. We lower fan from 0.86→0.82 (~13% fan power reduction via cubic law) and coil valve from 1.0→0.96 (~11% pump power reduction). 
Step 4 – Static-pressure logic: Keep at least one damper at 100% open to minimize throttling and required static pressure; we keep two (Z1 and Z2) fully open. 
Step 5 – Selected adjustments and expected effects: 
- OA damper 0.42→0.32 (moderate decrease). With fan 0.86→0.82, estimated OA flow ~27–30% lower, likely keeping Z1 near or just below 1000 ppm with a small negative/flat trend. 
- Fan speed 0.86→0.82 to cut fan power while maintaining comfort, with Z1/Z2 dampers fully open to prioritize their loads. 
- Coil valve 1.0→0.96 to capture pump savings given reduced OA (lower load) while preserving capacity. 
- Zone dampers: keep Z1 and Z2 at 1.0; trim Z3 to 0.90 and Z4 to 0.85 to balance comfort and reduce throttling. 
Safety/margin check: All commands within bounds. Expect temperatures to remain in 25–27°C and trend toward 26°C, with Z2 slightly cooling. CO2 in Z1 should remain ≤1000 ppm; if next interval shows CO2 rising >+2 ppm/min or any zone >26.8°C, increment OA (e.g., +0.04) or fan (+0.02) preferentially, keeping at least one damper at 1.0.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.9, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.32, ""coil_valve"": 0.96, ""fan_speed"": 0.82}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current states vs. targets: All zones are within 25–27°C but slightly warm (Z2=26.6°C worst). CO2: Z1 is at 1000 ppm with a +2 ppm/min rise (would exceed 1000 in next 5 min). Z2 is 986 ppm with +1.6 ppm/min; others are comfortable.
2) Priorities: Prevent CO2 exceedance (≤1000 ppm target, never >1050). Maintain comfort near 26°C. Minimise power: prefer water-side (coil) to fan; minimise outdoor air unless needed for CO2.
3) OA/ventilation strategy: To reduce Z1/Z2 CO2 without unnecessary OA load, first redistribute supply toward Z1/Z2 by throttling Z3/Z4 dampers while keeping Z1 and Z2 at 100% open (static-pressure reset principle). This increases OA delivered to high-CO2 zones at nearly the same OA fraction. Because Z1 is already at 1000 ppm and rising, add a modest OA fraction increase to ensure a downward CO2 trend while staying moderate on energy.
4) Cooling capacity vs. power: Increase coil_valve to 1.00 (water-side is cheaper and nearly maxed already) to help pull temps (especially Z2) down despite warmer OA. Bump fan_speed slightly to raise total flow/ventilation, but keep the change modest due to cubic power scaling.
5) Setpoints chosen: - Zone dampers: keep Z1=1.0 and Z2=1.0 (fully open), reduce Z3 from 0.90→0.80 and Z4 from 0.85→0.70 to prioritize airflow to Z1/Z2 and lower throttling losses while keeping at least one damper at 100% open (here two).
- OA damper: 0.32→0.34 (small increase) to ensure Z1 CO2 drops below 1000 given its current positive trend.
- Coil valve: 0.96→1.00 to maximize water-side cooling (energy-favorable vs. fan) and counteract added OA load.
- Fan speed: 0.82→0.85 (modest rise) to improve sensible capacity and ventilation while limiting cubic fan power.
6) Expected outcomes in next 5 minutes: Z1/Z2 get higher flow and more OA; Z1 CO2 trend should turn neutral/negative, keeping ≤1000 ppm; Z2 CO2 remains safely below 1000. Z2 temperature should start trending down toward 26°C; Z3/Z4 may cool a bit slower but remain in 25–27°C band. Changes are smooth and within bounds.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.7], ""oa_damper"": 0.34, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.85}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort status: All zones within 25–27°C. Z1=26.2 (-0.01°C/min), Z2=26.5 (~flat), Z3=26.4 (~flat), Z4=26.3 (-0.01°C/min). With current trends, all remain within band next 5 min without extra cooling. Coil valve is already at 1.0 (water side max), so added load relief should not come from more OA or less flow.
2) CO2 status: Z1=1000 ppm and drifting up ~+0.1 ppm/min; others have margin (Z2=987, Z3=972, Z4=842). Objective is ≤1000 ppm; must never exceed 1050 ppm. To avoid raising chiller load (hot/humid OA) and fan power, prefer redistributing existing supply toward Z1 rather than increasing OA fraction or fan.
3) Energy strategy: Pump (coil) already at max; increasing fan is expensive (cubic) and not needed for comfort. Increasing OA fraction increases coil/chiller load with hot 34.8°C/0.019 kg/kg air. Therefore: keep OA at current minimum that meets CO2 via redistribution. Maintain at least one damper fully open (static-pressure reset principle) to minimize throttling; use Z1=100% open, slightly throttle others to bias flow to Z1.
4) Actuator choices:
   - Zone dampers: Keep Z1 at 1.0; slightly reduce Z2 to 0.95 (limit warming of Z2 while freeing flow for Z1); reduce Z3 to 0.75 and Z4 to 0.65 (both have temp/CO2 headroom). This should increase Z1’s share of supply/ventilation and curb its CO2 drift without increasing system OA.
   - OA damper: Hold at 0.34 to minimize OA load while relying on redistribution for Z1 CO2 control.
   - Coil valve: Stay at 1.0 (water-side is cheaper than air-side; already saturated).
   - Fan speed: Hold at 0.85 to avoid capacity loss; once redistribution proves sufficient and if other dampers approach fully open, we can consider a small fan reduction next interval.
5) Smoothness/limits: All changes are small, within bounds, and avoid oscillation. If Z1 CO2 is still ≥1000 next interval, next step would be a minor OA increase (+0.01–0.02) or a very small fan increase (+0.01) as a secondary measure, favoring the smallest change that meets CO2 without harming comfort.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.95, 0.75, 0.65], ""oa_damper"": 0.34, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.85}","{

Keep temperatures near 26°C without overshooting or large actuator moves. 2) CO2/ventilation: Zone 1 is at 1006 ppm and slowly rising (+1 ppm/min). We must bring it to ≤1000 ppm and prevent any zone exceeding 1050 ppm. Zones 2–4 are ≤1000 ppm, with Z3 trending up but still safe. 3) Outdoor air is hot and humid (≈35°C, high AH). To minimize energy, keep OA as low as possible but increase just enough to reverse Z1’s CO2 trend. Avoid large fan increases (cubic power). 4) Static-pressure/airflow strategy: Keep at least one damper fully open to reduce throttling losses; keep Zone 1 at 100%. Slightly pinch zones with adequate CO2 and near-target temperatures (Z3, Z4) to bias more flow/ventilation to Z1 without raising fan speed. Leave Z2 damper as-is because it’s the warmest (26.5°C) and already cooling slowly. 5) Fan vs. coil: Fan power scales cubically; prefer not to increase fan. Coil valve already at 1.0; with higher OA fraction and hot/humid air, keep coil at 1.0 this interval to maintain comfort. 6) Actuator choices: Increase OA damper moderately (0.34→0.42) to reverse Z1 CO2 trend while containing latent load; reallocate airflow via dampers (Z1 100%, Z3/Z4 slightly reduced). Hold fan speed steady (0.85) to avoid cubic power penalty and oscillations. 7) Expected outcome (next 5–10 min): Z1 CO2 should start decreasing toward ≤1000 ppm; other zones remain below 1000 ppm. Temperatures should stay within band and near 26°C. If Z1 CO2 remains above target next interval, increment OA slightly; if CO2 improves and temps remain stable, consider trimming coil/fan for further savings.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.95, 0.68, 0.58], ""oa_damper"": 0.42, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.85}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning and checks:
1) Current state summary:
- Temps (target 26.0°C, band 25–27°C): Z1 26.2 (flat), Z2 26.5 (slightly cooling), Z3 26.5 (slightly warming), Z4 26.3 (flat).
- CO2 (≤1000 ppm desired, never >1050): Z1 992 (−2.5 ppm/min), Z2 964 (−3.3), Z3 977 (−0.8), Z4 835 (−1.9). All trending down at current OA.
- Outdoor 35°C and humid; reducing OA saves coil/chiller power.
- Previous actuators: dampers [1.00, 0.95, 0.68, 0.58], OA 0.42, coil 1.00, fan 0.85.

2) Comfort needs by zone:
- Z3 needs more cooling (26.5 and rising slightly). Priority zone.
- Z2 slightly high (26.5, slowly dropping) – modest extra cooling helpful.
- Z1 near target (26.2) – avoid overcooling.
- Z4 fine (26.3) – can accept less air.

3) Ventilation/CO2 strategy:
- All zones <1000 ppm and decreasing. We can reduce OA to cut load, but avoid flipping trends to exceed 1000. A moderate step down (not to minimum) is safer this interval.

4) Energy strategy and constraints:
- Use water (coil_valve) first (cheaper than fan). Coil already at 1.0; keep it there.
- Reallocate airflow via zone dampers to favor hotter zones, keeping at least one damper at 100% open to minimize required static pressure (and thus fan power).
- Slight fan reduction is feasible because: (a) colder mixed air from reduced OA improves cooling effectiveness; (b) we’ll fully open Z3 and throttle Z1/Z4, which reduces throttling losses.

5) Actuator choices:
- Zone dampers: set Z3 to 1.00 (maximize flow to the warmest zone). Keep Z2 high at 0.95 to aid cooling. Throttle Z1 to 0.80 to prevent overcooling and reduce throttling losses. Throttle Z4 to 0.50 as it’s comfortable.
- OA damper: reduce from 0.42 to 0.30 (moderate reduction to lower coil/chiller load while maintaining CO2 margin; trends should remain ≤1000 ppm over next 5 minutes).
- Coil valve: hold at 1.00 (already at limit; water-side energy is cheaper than fan for the same load).
- Fan speed: small reduction from 0.85 to 0.83 to save fan power while relying on colder mixed air and airflow reallocation to maintain/boost cooling in Z2/Z3.

6) Checks vs. objectives/constraints:
- Comfort: More air to Z3 (1.00) and maintained high to Z2 (0.95) plus colder mixed air should pull both toward 26°C; Z1 throttled to 0.80 to avoid dropping below 26. Z4 at 0.50 should hold near 26.3. All expected within 25–27°C.
- CO2: OA reduced to 0.30 (not minimum). Given all zones currently decreasing CO2, this should keep all ≤1000 ppm this interval and well below 1050. Monitor Z1 (was 992) closely next interval.
- Energy: Fan drop 0.85→0.83 reduces P_fan by ≈7% (0.83^3/0.85^3 ≈ 0.93). OA reduction lowers coil/chiller load significantly in hot-humid conditions. Coil remains at 1.0 (pump power unchanged but preferred over increasing fan). One damper (Z3) at 100% open satisfies static-pressure reset intent.

7) Smoothness/anti-oscillation:
- OA change moderate (0.42→0.30), fan small (−0.02), dampers adjusted with one step to reallocate flow without excessive swings. All settings within bounds.

8) Bounds check (all clipped if needed):

Energy strategy: avoid increasing fan speed due to cubic power; use coil (already at max) and damper reallocation; keep at least one zone damper fully open to lower required static. Actions: increase OA damper to provide a short CO2 flush; set Zone 1 damper to 1.0 (the 100% open zone) and slightly throttle Zones 2–3 to reallocate flow toward Zone 1 while maintaining their comfort/CO2; keep Zone 4 steady. Keep coil at 1.0 given hot/humid OA to prevent supply temp rise; keep fan speed unchanged to avoid cubic power increase while still delivering added OA to Zone 1 via damper reallocation. Reassess next interval to trim OA back once CO2 < 1000 ppm."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Assess current state vs. objectives.
- Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C but slightly warm (26.2–26.4°C). Temperature trends are near flat; Zone 4 is creeping up (+0.01°C/min). We want a slight cooling bias to pull toward 26.0°C without overshoot.
- CO2: Zone 1 is 993 ppm and rising ~+1.7 ppm/min, which would exceed 1000 ppm within ~5–6 minutes if unchanged. Zones 2–4 are below 1000 ppm with slower rises. We must keep all ≤ 1000 ppm (hard limit 1050 ppm).
- Outdoor air: Very hot and humid (35.1°C, high absolute humidity). Increasing OA would increase coil load; preference is to avoid raising OA fraction.

Step 2: Power/efficiency considerations.
- Use coil (water-side) first since pump-side energy is generally cheaper than fan for the same added cooling; both scale ~cube with their control but pump typically has better efficiency.
- Avoid large fan speed increases due to cubic power scaling; only fine-tune if needed for CO2 and minor temperature trims.
- Keep at least one zone damper fully open to reduce throttling and static pressure requirements; Zone 1 already at 100% and is the limiting CO2 zone.

Step 3: Strategy.
- Cooling: Nudge coil_valve from 0.95 → 1.00 to slightly increase sensible capacity without a big fan penalty.
- Ventilation/CO2: Keep OA damper at current 0.35 to avoid extra latent/sensible load while maintaining current dilution capability. Slightly increase fan speed (0.80 → 0.83) to boost total ventilation and sensible capacity a bit.
- Air distribution: Keep Zone 1 damper at 1.0 (static pressure reset anchor and to prioritize airflow to the highest CO2 zone). Slightly trim Zone 2 and 3 dampers (0.85 → 0.80) to bias more airflow toward Zone 1 without starving 2/3 (their CO2 is comfortably < 1000). Keep Zone 4 at 0.50 given its low CO2; coil and slight fan increase should help arrest its small temp rise without increasing its damper.

Step 4: Expected outcomes next 5 minutes.
- Zone 1: Increased share + slightly higher fan reduces CO2 rise, keeping ≤ 1000 ppm; added cooling pulls temperature toward 26.0°C from 26.2°C.
- Zones 2/3: Minor damper trims offset by higher coil and modest fan increase; temperatures should hold or drop slightly toward ~26.2–26.3°C; CO2 remains < 1000 ppm.
- Zone 4: With coil at 1.0 and modestly higher airflow, temperature creep should stabilize or drop slightly; CO2 remains low.
- Energy: Pump increase (0.95→1.0) is preferred over larger fan changes; the fan increase is minimal (0.80→0.83) to meet CO2 and fine-tune comfort. OA is not increased to avoid chiller/coil penalties.

Step 5: Smoothness and bounds.
- All moves are small, within bounds, and avoid oscillation risk. Maintain at least one damper at 100% (Zone 1).","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.8, 0.8, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.83}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of reasoning and decisions: 1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C but slightly warm (26.2–26.4°C) with essentially flat temperature trends and the cooling coil already at 1.0. To pull temperatures toward 26°C without oscillation, additional sensible capacity is needed via increased supply airflow across the coil. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is at 996 ppm and trending up ~+0.7 ppm/min; others are ≤ 974 ppm with positive trends. To keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (and never >1050 ppm), we need a modest ventilation increase. Raising outdoor-air fraction would sharply increase coil/chiller load due to 35°C hot/humid OA, so prefer increasing total airflow (fan) at the same OA fraction, which still increases absolute OA intake slightly for dilution without a big latent/sensible penalty from higher OA fraction. 3) Energy trade-offs: Pump/coil is already maxed (valve=1.0), and water-side increases are unavailable; per cubic scaling, we keep the fan change small. Keeping OA fraction constant avoids extra mixed-air load. 4) Dampers and static pressure: Keep Zone 1 damper at 100% open to satisfy static-pressure reset logic and minimize throttling losses. To avoid oscillations and preserve current distribution, keep other dampers unchanged this interval. 5) Chosen adjustments: Slightly increase fan speed from 0.83 to 0.87 (≈+15% fan power) to boost cooling and ventilation; hold OA damper at 0.35 to limit outdoor load; coil valve stays at 1.0; dampers unchanged. This should bring temps closer to 26°C and arrest Zone 1 CO2 rise while respecting bounds. We will reassess next interval and, if CO2 stabilizes, consider trimming fan or coil to save power.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.8, 0.8, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.35, ""coil_valve"": 1.0, ""fan_speed"": 0.87}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of decisions and rationale:
- Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C and slightly above setpoint (26.1–26.4°C) with mostly mild downward trends. To keep zones near 26°C while avoiding overcooling, we slightly reduce airflow to Zones 2 and 3 and open Zone 4 a bit, while keeping Zone 1 fully open for priority cooling/ventilation.
- CO2/ventilation: Zone 1 is at 1003 ppm and trending up. To drive CO2 downward without increasing outdoor air fraction (which would raise coil/chiller load in very hot/humid OA), we modestly increase total airflow and redistribute more flow to Zone 1. This should increase its dilution air and flip or reduce the CO2 trend while keeping OA fraction unchanged.
- Energy trade-off: We slightly reduce coil water flow (pump power cubic) and slightly increase fan speed (fan power cubic). With matched small magnitudes, this balances capacity (Q ≈ k_air*f + k_water*w) and yields comparable or slightly lower combined fan+pump power while improving CO2. Keeping OA damper unchanged minimizes chiller/coil load from hot, humid outdoor air.
- Static-pressure logic: Keep at least one damper fully open (Zone 1 at 100%) and keep others as open as feasible while meeting comfort (Zones 2/3 only slightly throttled; Zone 4 opened a bit) to avoid excessive throttling losses and unnecessary fan pressure.
- Smooth changes: All adjustments are small/moderate to avoid oscillations and respect bounds.
- Expected effects over next 5 minutes: Zone 1 CO2 trend should reduce or turn negative; temperatures remain within 25–27°C and closer to 26°C in Zone 1. If Zone 1 CO2 remains >1000 ppm next interval, increase fan speed slightly further or consider a small OA increase as a secondary step.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.9, 0.9, 0.55], ""oa_damper"": 0.33, ""coil_valve"": 0.95, ""fan_speed"": 0.95}","{

CO2 ppm: Z1=999 (−0.7 ppm/min), Z2=962 (−0.4), Z3=975 (−0.5), Z4=852 (flat). OA=35.1°C and humid, so reducing OA saves coil/chiller power. Current actuators are high: fan=0.95, coil=0.95, OA=0.33, dampers [1.0, 0.9, 0.9, 0.55].
2) CO2/ventilation: Z1 is the tightest at 999 ppm but trending down. We must not let any zone exceed 1000 ppm (hard cap 1050). To minimize OA while staying safe, reduce OA slightly and also reduce fan speed moderately; keep Z1 damper at 100% to bias supply/ventilation toward Z1. Ventilation proxy ∝ fan*OA. Previous: 0.95*0.33=0.3135. Proposed: 0.83*0.31=0.2573 (−17.9%). Approximate Z1 CO2 slope scales similarly: −0.7*(1−0.179) ≈ −0.575 ppm/min, so in 5 min Z1 would drop ~2.9 ppm to ~996 ppm, remaining ≤1000 and far below 1050. Other zones have more margin.
3) Thermal/electric trade-off: Use Q ≈ k_air*f + k_water*w and cubic power laws. Reduce fan first (bigger cubic savings), keep coil relatively high (water-side is cheaper per unit load). Previous Q surrogate: 0.95+0.95=1.90. Proposed: 0.83+0.90=1.73 (≈9% lower), which should still maintain comfort because (a) zones are already cooling, (b) OA is reduced, lowering load. Fan power: 0.95^3=0.857 → 0.83^3=0.571 (~33% fan power reduction). Pump power: 0.95^3=0.857 → 0.90^3=0.729 (~15% pump reduction).
4) Static-pressure reset logic: Keep at least one damper at 100% open. Maintain Z1 at 1.0. Slightly open Z2 and Z3 (0.95) to reduce throttling. Open Z4 from 0.55 to 0.65 to help the warmest zone and further reduce required static pressure, enabling lower fan power.
5) Smoothness/limits: All changes are modest and within bounds. Monitoring plan: If Z1 CO2 stops decreasing next interval, nudge OA up by ~0.02 or fan by ~0.03.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of reasoning and actions: 1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C but slightly above the 26°C target and mostly flat; we will maintain or slightly increase cooling capacity to avoid drift upward, especially with hotter/humid OA. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is at 1014 ppm and rising; Zones 2 and 3 are in the high 900s and trending up. Immediate priority is to drive CO2 down without overshooting energy. The most direct lever is outdoor-air fraction; damper changes in other zones won’t address CO2 sufficiently and may increase throttling. 3) Energy strategy: To meet added ventilation load, favor increasing coil (water-side) over fan, because pump-side is typically cheaper than fan for the same load. Keep at least one zone damper fully open (Zone 1 already at 100%) to minimize static pressure. Avoid large fan increases; keep zone dampers steady to prevent oscillations. 4) Chosen adjustments: Increase OA damper significantly (from 0.31 to 0.43) to quickly reverse CO2 rise and pull Zone 1 back under 1000 ppm while stabilizing Zones 2–3. Slightly bump fan speed (0.83 → 0.84) to modestly raise total airflow and ventilation without a large fan power penalty. Increase coil valve (0.90 → 0.95) to offset the higher mixed-air temperature/humidity from the added OA and maintain zone temperatures near 26°C. Keep zone dampers unchanged with Zone 1 at 100% to satisfy static-pressure reset logic. 5) Expected effects (qualitative): OA absolute flow increases ~40% (vs previous), reversing CO2 trends; fan power rises slightly (≈+4% vs prior), pump power rises more (≈+17% vs prior), which is acceptable short-term to meet IAQ. Once all zones are ≤ 980–990 ppm and stable, we will step OA down and trim coil to reduce total power.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.95, 0.95, 0.65], ""oa_damper"": 0.43, ""coil_valve"": 0.95, ""fan_speed"": 0.84}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Assess current state vs. constraints.
- Temperatures: All zones are 26.1–26.3°C, within the 25–27°C band and slightly above the 26°C target; temperature trends ~0.0°C/min (stable).
- CO2: Z1=1000 ppm (exact limit) trending down (-2.5 ppm/min); others 841–973 ppm, all trending down. We can safely reduce outdoor air but must do it conservatively to keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm.
- Outdoor: 35.2°C and humid; outdoor air increases cooling/dehumidification load. Reducing OA will lower coil/chiller load.
- Actuators (previous): dampers mostly open; OA damper relatively high (0.43); coil valve very high (0.95); fan speed moderate (0.84).

Step 2: Control strategy per objectives.
- Ventilation/CO2: Reduce OA fraction to minimize load while keeping CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm, especially for Zone 1 at 1000 ppm but trending down. Use a moderate step to avoid flipping trend positive. Choose OA damper 0.30 (from 0.43), expecting CO2 to continue decreasing or remain ~flat, aided by slightly higher effective zone airflow from opening dampers.
- Cooling/load balance: Since zones are slightly warm but stable, reduce OA load and trim coil slightly to save pump/chiller energy while keeping comfort near 26°C. Choose coil_valve 0.92 (from 0.95) to avoid overcooling while leveraging reduced OA load and improved distribution from damper opening.
- Airflow/power: Keep at least one damper at 100% open to minimize static pressure. Open Z2 and Z3 to 1.0 and increase Z4 from 0.65 to 0.80 to reduce throttling and improve its cooling, which should nudge zone temps toward 26°C. Maintain fan_speed at 0.84 this interval to avoid reducing ventilation too much concurrently with OA reduction.
- Smoothness: All changes are moderate; largest is Z4 damper +0.15, which is acceptable.

Step 3: Power rationale.
- Fan power ~ f^3: keeping f=0.84 avoids CO2 risk; damper opening reduces throttling losses, potentially enabling lower f in future.
- Pump/coil power ~ w^3: lowering coil from 0.95 to 0.92 reduces pump/compression energy (approx 9% relative on pump surrogate) while OA reduction also cuts cooling load.

Step 4: Constraints check.
- Comfort: More open dampers plus slightly lower OA load should keep or bring zones closer to 26°C within 25–27°C.
- CO2: OA reduced moderately; with dampers more open and fan unchanged, expect Z1 to remain ≤1000 ppm with a near-zero to slightly negative trend; all zones remain well below 1050 ppm.
- Static-pressure rule: Multiple zones at 100% (Z1, Z2, Z3) satisfy the requirement.
- Bounds: All commands within provided limits.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary: All zones are within 25–27°C and drifting slightly cooler. CO2 is near the 1000 ppm limit in Zone 1 (997 ppm, rising). Outdoor air is very hot and humid, so we keep OA low but must prevent CO2 exceedance. Strategy: prioritize coil (water) over fan for load, keep at least one damper at 100% open, and make smooth changes.

(2) Slightly increase OA damper just enough to prevent Zone 1 from crossing 1000 ppm, given the current upward trend. (3) Slightly bump fan speed to modestly boost total ventilation with a small power penalty, while (4) trimming the coil valve to reduce pump power and offset added airflow cooling. This balances comfort, keeps CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm with margin, minimizes OA increase, and slightly reduces total electrical power due to a larger pump-power reduction than the small fan-power increase.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.9, 1.0, 0.75], ""oa_damper"": 0.28, ""coil_valve"": 0.88, ""fan_speed"": 0.83}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Others are ≤995 ppm and stable/declining. To minimize outdoor air load, hold OA damper steady rather than increase; a small fan reduction should not push any zone above 1000 ppm over the next 5 minutes, but we’ll watch Zone 3 closely. 3) Energy: Use cubic scaling—reduce fan modestly and slightly increase coil to maintain sensible load (Q ≈ k_air*f + k_water*w). Open non-critical zone dampers a bit to reduce throttling while keeping at least one zone damper fully open to satisfy static-pressure reset logic. 4) Actuator moves are intentionally small to avoid oscillations.

  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.

Z1, Z2, Z4 are slightly below setpoint and drifting down (~0.01°C/min). Z3 is slightly above setpoint (26.2°C) and roughly flat. To avoid overcooling the slightly cool zones and gently guide Z3 toward 26°C, reduce overall cooling slightly and rebalance air distribution toward Z3. 2) Assess CO2/ventilation: Z3 is at 999 ppm and trending up (~+0.4 ppm/min); others are below 1000 ppm with slower trends. To keep all ≤1000 ppm without increasing outdoor air (OA), increase Z3’s share of total supply by slightly throttling lower-CO2, slightly cool zones (Z1, Z2).

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1 – Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C. Trends are slightly cooling (~-0.01°C/min) in all zones, so without adjustment some zones could drift below 26°C and eventually risk approaching 25°C. Zone 3 is warmest at 26.1°C but is also trending down, so only a mild reduction in cooling is needed. Step 2 – CO2/ventilation: Z3=999 ppm (falling ~-0.2 ppm/min) and Z1=994 ppm (falling ~-0.5 ppm/min). This indicates current outdoor air is slightly higher than needed; we can trim OA a little while staying ≤1000 ppm (and never >1050). Step 3 – Energy trade-offs: To reduce total power, first reduce coil (pump/chiller load) and OA intake (cuts chiller load significantly in hot weather) while keeping at least one damper at 100% open for low static pressure. Avoid large fan changes because fan power scales cubically and ventilation reductions could push CO2 up; make only a small fan reduction to avoid oscillations and maintain CO2 margin. Step 4 – Actuator choices: Keep Z3 damper at 100% (critical zone for temperature and CO2). Keep Z1 damper at 100% as it has relatively high CO2; this supports ventilation to that zone. Leave Z2 and Z4 dampers as before to avoid unnecessary redistribution. Reduce coil_valve from 0.86→0.82 to ease cooling and save pump/chiller energy. Slightly reduce OA damper 0.29→0.28 to cut ventilation load while CO2 remains ≤1000 (Z3’s decreasing trend provides margin).

  ""thought_process"": ""Step 1 – Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C. Trends are slightly cooling (~-0.01°C/min) in all zones, so without adjustment some zones could drift below 26°C and eventually risk approaching 25°C. Zone 3 is warmest at 26.1°C but is also trending down, so only a mild reduction in cooling is needed. Step 2 – CO2/ventilation: Z3=999 ppm (falling ~-0.2 ppm/min) and Z1=994 ppm (falling ~-0.5 ppm/min). This indicates current outdoor air is slightly higher than needed; we can trim OA a little while staying ≤1000 ppm (and never >1050). Step 3 – Energy trade-offs: To reduce total power, first reduce coil (pump/chiller load) and OA intake (cuts chiller load significantly in hot weather) while keeping at least one damper at 100% open for low static pressure. Avoid large fan changes because fan power scales cubically and ventilation reductions could push CO2 up; make only a small fan reduction to avoid oscillations and maintain CO2 margin. Step 4 – Actuator choices: Keep Z3 damper at 100% (critical zone for temperature and CO2). Keep Z1 damper at 100% as it has relatively high CO2; this supports ventilation to that zone. Leave Z2 and Z4 dampers as before to avoid unnecessary redistribution. Reduce coil_valve from 0.86→0.82 to ease cooling and save pump/chiller energy. Slightly reduce OA damper 0.29→0.28 to cut ventilation load while CO2 remains ≤1000 (Z3’s decreasing trend provides margin).

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step 1: Assess current conditions and risks.
- Temperatures: All zones are within 25–27°C and close to 26°C. All zones are drifting slightly cooler (~−0.01°C/min), so we should avoid adding cooling; a slight reduction in cooling is acceptable to stay centered near 26°C.
- CO2: Zone 3 is at 1001 ppm and rising (+0.3 ppm/min). Others are ≤ 1000 ppm with moderate upward trends. We must bring Zone 3 ≤ 1000 ppm while keeping OA minimal.
- Actuators (prev): zone dampers [Z1=1.0, Z2=0.8, Z3=1.0, Z4=0.65], OA=0.28, coil=0.82, fan=0.81.

Step 2: Control strategy per objectives.
- Comfort/load: Reduce water-side (coil_valve) slightly to cut pump/chiller load and counteract slight overcooling. This follows the guideline that increasing water flow is cheaper than fan for the same load, so for load reduction we trim water first.
- Ventilation/CO2: Minimise OA intake. First, reallocate airflow toward Zone 3 by reducing dampers in zones not CO2-limited, keeping at least one damper at 100% open for static-pressure reset. Add a very small fan increase to boost total ventilation (and OA cfm) without increasing OA fraction, keeping OA at current 0.28.

Step 3: Specific adjustments and rationale.
- Zone dampers: Keep Zone 3 at 1.0 to be the pressure reset zone and maximise its ventilation. Slightly reduce Zone 1 from 1.0→0.95 (still comfortable, CO2 near 995 so be cautious). Keep Zone 2 at 0.8 (CO2 962 trending up; avoid reducing its ventilation). Reduce Zone 4 from 0.65→0.55 (CO2 860 with headroom; temperature slightly cool so this also reduces unnecessary cooling), which shifts more system airflow to Zone 3.
- Fan speed: Increase slightly 0.81→0.82 (+1.2% speed). Fan power changes cubically: 0.81^3≈0.531 to 0.82^3≈0.551 (~+3.8% fan power). This modest bump increases total ventilation and OA cfm without increasing OA fraction, helping Zone 3 CO2 drop below 1000 while minimising OA.
- OA damper: Hold at 0.28 to minimise outdoor air on a hot/humid day, since raising OA would increase chiller load. The combination of rebalancing and a small fan bump should be sufficient to reverse the CO2 rise in Zone 3.
- Coil valve: Reduce 0.82→0.78 to slightly decrease cooling (Q≈k_air*f+k_water*w; previously ≈0.81+0.82=1.63, now ≈0.82+0.78=1.60, a small net reduction). This helps prevent further overcooling while saving pump power and partially offsets the added sensible capacity from the slight fan increase.

Step 4: Check constraints and smoothness.
- Bounds: All commands within given limits. At least one zone damper (Zone 3) is 100% open to satisfy static pressure reset. Changes are modest to avoid oscillations.

Step 5: Expected outcomes (next 5 min).
- Zone 3: Increased share of airflow plus +1.2% fan should provide > a few percent increase in ventilation to Z3; with OA fraction unchanged, OA cfm to Z3 increases, driving CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm. Temperature should hold near 26°C given slight net reduction in coil cooling.
- Other zones: Slightly less cooling and slightly less airflow (Z1, Z4) should nudge them closer to 26°C without leaving 25–27°C. Zone 2 remains ventilated enough while staying near 26°C.

Overall: Meets comfort (stay near 26°C), corrects Zone 3 CO2 to ≤ 1000 ppm while keeping OA minimal, and reduces total power by trimming coil water and only minimally increasing fan.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.95, 0.8, 1.0, 0.55], ""oa_damper"": 0.28, ""coil_valve"": 0.78, ""fan_speed"": 0.82}","{

CO2: Z3 is slightly high at 1001 ppm (must be ≤1000), Z1 is tight at 995 ppm and rising slowly, Z2 (962) and Z4 (863) have margin. Outdoor air is very hot/humid (35.2°C), so OA should be minimized subject to CO2 constraints. 2) CO2 strategy: Z3 must come down below 1000 and Z1 must not rise above 1000. To increase ventilation effectiveness without large fan increases, fully open dampers for Z3 (already 1.0) and also Z1 (from 0.95→1.0) so these priority zones receive maximum share at any given static pressure. Slightly throttle Z2 and Z4 to shift airflow toward Z1/Z3 while keeping their CO2 within limits. Modestly increase OA fraction to provide enough dilution for both Z1 and Z3, keeping the increase small due to OA energy cost. 3) Energy strategy: Reduce coil valve first (pump-side more efficient than fan for load changes), then fine-tune fan speed down slightly to cut cubic fan power while ensuring ventilation remains adequate. Keep at least one damper at 100% (we keep two: Z1 and Z3) to allow lower static pressure and reduced fan speed. 4) Chosen adjustments: - Zone dampers: Z1=1.0 (↑ from 0.95), Z3=1.0 (hold), Z2=0.65 (↓ from 0.8), Z4=0.45 (↓ from 0.55). - OA damper: 0.32 (↑ from 0.28) to drive Z3 below 1000 ppm and stabilize Z1. - Coil valve: 0.70 (↓ from 0.78) to reduce cooling energy and let zones drift toward 26°C. - Fan speed: 0.80 (slightly ↓ from 0.82) to cut fan power while relying on damper prioritization and the modest OA increase to maintain ventilation for Z1/Z3. 5) Expected outcomes next 5 min: Z3 CO2 should trend negative and drop below 1000; Z1 CO2 should stabilize or decrease slightly; Z2 and Z4 may see slightly faster CO2 rise but remain well below 1000.

Keep at least one damper at 100% (we keep two: Z1 and Z3) to allow lower static pressure and reduced fan speed. 4) Chosen adjustments: - Zone dampers: Z1=1.0 (↑ from 0.95), Z3=1.0 (hold), Z2=0.65 (↓ from 0.8), Z4=0.45 (↓ from 0.55). - OA damper: 0.32 (↑ from 0.28) to drive Z3 below 1000 ppm and stabilize Z1. - Coil valve: 0.70 (↓ from 0.78) to reduce cooling energy and let zones drift toward 26°C. - Fan speed: 0.80 (slightly ↓ from 0.82) to cut fan power while relying on damper prioritization and the modest OA increase to maintain ventilation for Z1/Z3. 5) Expected outcomes next 5 min: Z3 CO2 should trend negative and drop below 1000; Z1 CO2 should stabilize or decrease slightly; Z2 and Z4 may see slightly faster CO2 rise but remain well below 1000. Temperatures should drift gently toward 26°C (no risk of breaching 27°C given small changes and short interval). 6) Constraints and smoothness: All actuators within bounds; at least one (two) zone dampers at 100% to support static-pressure reset; changes are moderate to avoid oscillations."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

- Conditions: All zones are within 25–27°C and slightly on the cool side (closest to 26°C). CO2 is acceptable but tightest in Zone 3 (994 ppm, decreasing). Outdoor air is hot/humid, so reducing OA saves significant cooling power.
- Strategy: Modestly reduce overall cooling and airflow to cut power while preventing overcooling. Keep Zone 3 damper at 100% to maintain ventilation there (static-pressure reset) and slightly trim dampers in cooler zones. Reduce OA only moderately (not to minimum) to keep Zone 3 CO2 at or below 1000 ppm. Prefer coil adjustments over fan per energy guidance and make smooth changes to avoid oscillations.
- Expected result: Zone temperatures drift gently toward 26°C without leaving the 25–27°C band; CO2 remains ≤1000 ppm; total power drops via cubic fan/pump scaling and reduced OA load.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess comfort vs. target 26°C: Z1=25.4 (slightly cool), Z2=25.9 (near target), Z3=25.8 (slightly cool), Z4=26.1 (slightly warm). All within 25–27°C.
2) Assess CO2 vs. limits: Z1=996 ppm (+2.4 ppm/min) and Z2=998 ppm (+1.9 ppm/min) are poised to exceed 1000 ppm if unchanged; Z3=973, Z4=870 are safe. We must increase ventilation to Z1 and Z2 while minimizing OA.
3) Power trade-offs: Fan power scales ~f^3, pump ~w^3 (cheaper than fan for same load), but CO2 requires OA/airflow. Avoid increasing fan if possible; use OA fraction minimally and redistribute airflow via zone dampers. Keep at least one damper at 100% for static-pressure reset to minimize throttling/fan power.
4) Strategy: a) Slightly increase OA fraction just enough to arrest CO2 rise. b) Reallocate airflow toward Z1 and Z2 by opening their dampers and trimming Z3 (still comfortable, CO2-safe). c) Keep fan speed steady to avoid cubic penalty. d) Keep coil valve unchanged to maintain current cooling balance given hot OA (34.4°C); Z1/Z3 are slightly cool, Z4 slightly warm but slow trend, so hold coil and let damper changes handle zone balance.
5) Selected adjustments: - Zone dampers: Z1 to 1.0 (maximize ventilation; also maintains at least one damper fully open), Z2 to 0.95 (boost ventilation), Z3 to 0.90 (reduce cooling/vent to free capacity to Z1/Z2 and drift toward 26°C), Z4 stays 0.30 (avoid stealing flow; Z4 is only slightly warm). - OA damper: 0.33 (modest increase from 0.26; combined with damper reallocations should flatten or reverse CO2 trends in Z1/Z2 while minimizing OA). - Fan speed: hold at 0.75 (avoid cubic fan power increase). - Coil valve: hold at 0.50 (OA increase raises coil load slightly; keeping coil steady avoids over-warming Z4 and keeps Z1/Z3 near 26°C).
6) Expected outcomes next 5 min: CO2 in Z1/Z2 should stabilize at or below ~1000 ppm due to ~25–35% effective ventilation increase to those zones (OA fraction + damper boost). Temperatures remain within band; Z3 warms slightly toward 26, Z4 stable/slightly down due to overall balance.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zones 1–3 are slightly cool (25.4–25.9°C) and trending flat/slightly down; Zone 4 is slightly warm (26.1°C) and trending gently up.

Prefer avoiding large fan increases; here we reduce fan modestly and reduce coil valve slightly to trim sensible capacity. 4) Static pressure reset: Keep at least one zone damper at 100% open.

1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C; Z1 is slightly cool (25.4°C) and Z4 is trending a bit cooler than target. Aim to drift toward 26°C without overshoot.
2) CO2: Z1 (997 ppm, +1.1 ppm/min) and Z2 (998 ppm, +1.0 ppm/min) are about to exceed 1000 ppm if unchanged. Z3 is safe, Z4 is very safe.
3) Outdoor air is hot/humid; to minimize energy, keep OA fraction at current level and use damper redistribution first to deliver more OA to high-CO2 zones without increasing total OA intake.
4) Actions chosen:
   - Keep at least one damper fully open; set Z1 and Z2 dampers to 1.0 to lower throttling loss and boost their ventilation. Reduce Z4 damper to curb its cooling and reallocate flow toward Z1/Z2; keep Z3 as-is.
   - Slightly close coil valve to reduce pump/chiller load and prevent overcooling as more air goes to Z1/Z2.
   - Hold fan speed steady to avoid CO2 risk and oscillations; redistribution should address CO2 while saving energy via reduced throttling and lower coil flow.
5) Expected effects next 5 minutes: Z1/Z2 CO2 trends flatten or reverse, keeping ≤1000 ppm; Z4 cooling trend slows or reverses toward 26°C; Z1/Z3 remain within band. Pump power drops (~cubic with valve), and throttling losses reduce, meeting comfort/CO2 with minimal added energy.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess state: All zones within 25–27°C and near 26°C. CO2 is above 1000 ppm in Zones 1 (1018, +4.2 ppm/min) and 2 (1012, +3.4 ppm/min), trending upward; Zone 3 at 988 (+3.2), Zone 4 at 860 (+2.2). Outdoor air is hot/humid (34.1°C), so extra OA increases cooling load. 2) Risks if unchanged for 5 min: Z1 ≈ 1039 ppm, Z2 ≈ 1029 ppm; Z1 could exceed 1050 in ~8 min. Must increase ventilation now. 3) Strategy to minimize power while correcting CO2: First, increase OA fraction and rebalance zone dampers toward high-CO2 zones; keep fan speed steady to avoid cubic fan power penalty. Use coil valve (water flow) to offset the warmer mixed air; pump power is typically cheaper per load than fan power. Maintain at least one damper at 100% open for static-pressure reset (we will keep two at 100%). 4) Setpoints chosen: - OA damper from 0.22 to 0.38 (decisive but not extreme) to flip Z1/Z2 CO2 trends negative while avoiding excessive OA. - Zone dampers: Z1 → 1.0 (from 0.95) and keep Z2 at 1.0 to prioritize ventilation; slightly trim Z3 to 0.80 (from 0.85) and Z4 to 0.45 (from 0.50) to redirect flow without starving them. This keeps at least one damper at 100% and reduces throttling. - Fan speed: hold at 0.68 to avoid cubic fan power increase; increased OA and damper bias provide the needed ventilation effect. - Coil valve: modest increase to 0.54 (from 0.50) to counteract warmer OA and keep temps near 26°C without overcooling. 5) Power rationale (relative): P_fan stays ≈ 0.68^3 ≈ 0.314 (no change). P_pump rises from 0.50^3=0.125 to 0.54^3≈0.158 (+0.033), which is likely less costly than a fan bump achieving similar CO2 relief. 6) Expected outcomes over next 5 min: Z1/Z2 CO2 trends should turn slightly negative or near-zero, preventing approach to 1050 and beginning a return toward ≤1000. Temperatures should remain within 25–27°C and drift toward 26°C. 7) Next steps: If Z1/Z2 fall below 1000 ppm next interval, plan to trim OA back toward minimum and, if stable, reduce coil valve to save energy.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.45], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.54, ""fan_speed"": 0.68}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Strategy: Reduce fan speed slightly to cut cubic fan power while keeping OA fraction unchanged to maintain a downward CO2 trend. Slightly reduce coil valve to nudge temperatures toward 26°C and save pump/chiller power, but keep changes small to avoid oscillation.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary: CO2 is slightly high in Zone 1 (1002 ppm) and near the limit in Zone 2 (998 ppm), with both trending upward. Temperatures are within the 25–27°C band and close to the 26°C target, with slight upward drift. To improve ventilation while minimizing energy: avoid increasing fan speed due to cubic power penalty, and apply a small OA increase plus redistribution of airflow toward the higher-CO2 zones. Keep at least one zone damper fully open to support low static pressure. Slightly increase water-side (coil valve) to offset the modest added OA load without raising fan power.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state: Z1=25.7C (slightly cool), CO2=1008 ppm decreasing slowly; Z2=26.3C (slightly warm), CO2=1005 ppm flat; Z3=26.0C, CO2=960 ppm decreasing; Z4=26.2C (slightly warm), CO2=831 ppm decreasing. Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.5C, high AH), so OA is expensive. 2) Objectives: pull Z2 and Z4 closer to 26C, prevent Z1 from overcooling, and bring Z1/Z2 CO2 under 1000 while minimizing OA and total power. CO2 is the limiting factor; we must not reduce effective ventilation to Z1/Z2. 3) Air vs. water trade-off: Prefer adding cooling via coil (pump) over fan due to cubic power and typical η_pump > η_fan. Use dampers to redistribute flow first, keeping at least one damper at 100% open for static pressure reset. 4) Damper strategy: Keep Z1 and Z2 at 1.0 to a) maintain at least one fully open damper (actually two) and b) prioritize ventilation/cooling to the two zones near the CO2 limit and slightly warm (Z2). Reduce Z3 from 0.70→0.55 (temp and CO2 are comfortable; save airflow), and open Z4 from 0.35→0.55 to deliver more cooling to a slightly warm zone with low CO2. This reduces throttling and can increase total flow at the same fan speed. 5) OA damper: Because Z1/Z2 CO2 are at ~1000 ppm, do not reduce OA fraction this interval; keep it at 0.43 to avoid any CO2 rise. We will seek reductions once both are comfortably <1000 ppm. 6) Coil valve: Increase modestly 0.59→0.62 to provide extra sensible capacity with lower energy penalty than a comparable fan increase. This should nudge Z2/Z4 toward 26C without overcooling Z1 excessively (Z1 is currently trending slightly up). 7) Fan speed: Small increase 0.62→0.64 to slightly raise total ventilation and help bring Z1/Z2 CO2 below 1000 while avoiding a large cubic power hit. With dampers redistributed and at least one wide open, the system can deliver needed flow without high static pressure. 8) Power reasoning (relative): P_fan ~ f^3: 0.62^3≈0.238→0.64^3≈0.262 (~+10%). P_pump ~ w^3: 0.59^3≈0.205→0.62^3≈0.238 (~+16%). OA unchanged avoids extra latent/chiller load. 9) Expected outcomes in next 5–10 min: Z2 and Z4 cool toward ~26.1–26.2C and ~26.0–26.1C, respectively; Z1 remains within band near 25.7–25.9C; Z3 stays near 26C. CO2 in Z1/Z2 should trend downward from ~1008/1005 toward ≤1000 with the slight ventilation increase. If both fall below ~980 ppm next interval, we will start trimming OA fraction to cut coil/chiller load while holding CO2 safely under 1000. Changes are moderate to avoid oscillations while satisfying constraints.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.55, 0.55], ""oa_damper"": 0.43, ""coil_valve"": 0.62, ""fan_speed"": 0.64}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Assess current state:
- Temperatures: All zones are within 25–27°C; Zone 2 (26.4°C, drifting +0.01°C/min) is slightly warm relative to 26°C target. Zone 1 (25.8°C, +0.01°C/min) is slightly cool but near target. Zones 3 (26.0°C, +0.01°C/min) and 4 (26.1°C, −0.01°C/min) are acceptable.
- CO2: Zones 1 (1005 ppm, −0.7 ppm/min) and 2 (1003 ppm, −0.4 ppm/min) are just above the 1000 ppm target but trending down; Zones 3 (957 ppm) and 4 (820 ppm) are well below 1000 ppm.
- Outdoor air is hot and humid (33.6°C, AH 0.0184 kg/kg), so increasing OA raises coil/chiller load and latent energy significantly.

2) Control objectives and strategy:
- Bring Zone 1 and 2 CO2 to ≤1000 ppm while minimizing OA intake. To improve ventilation effectiveness without raising OA fraction, prioritize: (a) redistribute supply toward Z1/Z2 using zone dampers, (b) a small fan speed bump to raise total ventilation (cubic penalty considered), (c) keep OA damper steady to avoid latent load increase unless necessary.
- Cool Zone 2 slightly toward 26°C using the water side (coil valve) rather than a large fan increase, per guidance that water-side power is typically cheaper than fan.
- Maintain at least one zone damper at 100% open to reduce throttling/static losses (we keep Z1 and Z2 at 100%).

3) Actions chosen:
- Zone dampers: Keep Z1 and Z2 at 1.0 (fully open) to reduce throttling and maximize ventilation/cooling to the high-CO2/high-temp zones. Modestly throttle Z3 and Z4 from 0.55 → 0.45 to bias flow toward Z1/Z2 while keeping their temps within band.
- Fan speed: Small increase 0.64 → 0.66 to modestly boost total ventilation and airflow to Z1/Z2. Cubic penalty: (0.66/0.64)^3 ≈ +9–10% fan power; kept minimal.
- OA damper: Hold at 0.43 to minimize latent and sensible OA load, relying on higher total flow and redistribution to drop CO2 in Z1/Z2 below 1000 ppm.
- Coil valve: Small increase 0.62 → 0.64 to nudge supply air cooler, bringing Z2 closer to 26°C while Z3/Z4 receive less air (offsetting overcooling risk). Pump power cubic penalty is moderate and typically cheaper than fan for the same load.

4) Expected outcomes over next 5 min:
- CO2: Additional airflow to Z1/Z2 plus slight total flow increase should accelerate CO2 decay so both fall to ≤1000 ppm while staying well below the 1050 ppm hard limit.
- Temperatures: Z2 should drift toward ~26.2–26.3°C; Z1 ~25.7–25.9°C; Z3 ~26.1°C; Z4 ~26.1–26.2°C—all within 25–27°C and closer to 26°C.

5) Energy considerations:
- Avoided increasing OA fraction to prevent extra chiller/latent load. Applied minimal fan increase and a small coil increase, leveraging water-side efficiency and keeping at least one damper fully open to minimize throttling.

6) Next-step logic (for the following interval):
- If Z1/Z2 CO2 remain >1000 ppm, increment OA damper by 0.01–0.02 or add a small fan step while reassessing temps. If Z3/Z4 warm more than expected, ease their dampers back up slightly (e.g., 0.45 → 0.50) while maintaining at least one damper at 1.0.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.45, 0.45], ""oa_damper"": 0.43, ""coil_valve"": 0.64, ""fan_speed"": 0.66}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step rationale: 1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C. Zone 2 is slightly warm (26.4°C, rising slowly); Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.8°C), Zones 3–4 are near target. 2) CO2: All zones are <1000 ppm and currently trending down; this allows reducing outdoor air to save energy while staying within limits. 3) Outdoor is hot and humid (33.6°C, high AH), so reducing OA also cuts coil/chiller load. 4) Power trade-off: Because fan and pump power scale cubically and water-side is generally cheaper, favor a small increase in coil_valve with a modest fan reduction to maintain cooling for Zone 2 while cutting fan power. 5) Static pressure: Keep at least one zone damper at 100% (Zone 2 stays 1.0). Trim Zone 1 damper to reduce its slight overcooling; keep Zones 3–4 unchanged to avoid overcooling given a slightly colder supply. 6) Smoothness: Make modest changes except OA, which is driven toward minimum but not all the way to absolute minimum to avoid abrupt CO2 swings this interval. 7) Expected effects: OA reduction lowers mixed-air temperature and latent load; coil_valve +0.02 offsets the small fan reduction to help Zone 2 drift toward 26°C; Zone 1 warms slightly toward setpoint; Zones 3–4 remain near 26°C. 8) Power estimate vs previous: fan 0.66→0.62 ≈ −17% fan power; coil 0.64→0.66 ≈ +10% pump power; net electrical lower, plus reduced OA lowers chiller load. 9) Constraints check: All actuators within bounds; at least one damper at 100%; CO2 expected to remain ≤1000 ppm over next 5 minutes; will monitor and increase OA if CO2 rises toward limit.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 1.0, 0.45, 0.45], ""oa_damper"": 0.1, ""coil_valve"": 0.66, ""fan_speed"": 0.62}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Z2=1043 ppm rising +9.1 ppm/min likely to exceed shortly. Z3=991 ppm rising +6.8 ppm/min will cross 1000 soon if not addressed. Z4=844 ppm ok. 3) Ventilation strategy: Increase outdoor-air fraction to quickly reverse CO2 rise while minimizing fan power (fan power ~ f^3).

    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of observations and priorities:
- Comfort: All zones within 25–27°C; Zones 2 and 3 are slightly warm (+0.5 and +0.4°C), Zones 1 and 4 are near target.
- CO2: Zones 1 and 2 are slightly above 1000 ppm (1015, 1014) but trending down; must not reduce ventilation until they are ≤1000 ppm. Zones 3 and 4 are acceptable.
- Energy: Fan power is cubic with speed; prefer using the coil (water side) and damper redistribution before changing fan speed. Keep at least one zone damper at 100% to minimize static pressure needs.
Control rationale:
- Keep outdoor air fraction steady (not lower) to continue driving CO2 down in Zones 1 and 2. Avoid fan increase due to cubic penalty.
- Prioritize ventilation to high-CO2 zones by fully opening Zone 1 (matching Zone 2 at 100%) and throttling low-CO2 Zone 4; modestly open Zone 3 if needed for comfort while keeping overall flow modest.
- Address slight warmth primarily via a small coil valve increase (cheaper than fan) rather than raising fan speed.
- Maintain smooth changes to avoid oscillations.
Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes:
- CO2 in Zones 1 and 2 should continue decreasing, with more supply flow directed to them, improving toward ≤1000 ppm while staying well below the 1050 ppm limit.
- Temperatures should nudge closer to 26°C in Zones 2 and 3 without overcooling 1 and 4.
- Fan power held constant; pump power slightly higher due to coil increase, which is the lower-energy trade-off versus fan.
Next-step note: If Zones 1 and 2 drop to ≤1000 ppm next interval, we can begin trimming OA and then consider a small fan reset while keeping at least one damper at 100%.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.45, 0.3], ""oa_damper"": 0.44, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.66}","{

Temperatures: Zone 2 and 3 are warm; Zone 1 is slightly cool; Zone 4 is near target. To add cooling with lower electrical penalty, prefer increasing coil valve (water-side) rather than fan speed due to cubic power scaling. Maintain at least one damper fully open to minimize static-pressure throttling; keep Zone 1 and 2 dampers at 100% to maximize their ventilation while CO2 normalizes.

To add cooling with lower electrical penalty, prefer increasing coil valve (water-side) rather than fan speed due to cubic power scaling. Maintain at least one damper fully open to minimize static-pressure throttling; keep Zone 1 and 2 dampers at 100% to maximize their ventilation while CO2 normalizes.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning and trade-offs:
1) Comfort status: Z1=25.8 (-0.2, slightly cool, drifting down), Z2=26.5 (+0.5, warm, flat), Z3=26.3 (+0.3, slightly warm, drifting down), Z4=26.2 (+0.2, drifting up). Priority: give more cooling to Z2 and prevent Z4 drifting up; ease cooling to Z1.
2) CO2/ventilation: Z1=992 ppm (−1.7 ppm/min), Z2=995 (−1.5), Z3=967 (−2.6), Z4=821 (−0.2). With all zones ≤1000 and trending down, we can trim OA slightly but keep a safety margin to avoid exceeding 1000–1050.
3) Energy strategy: Use more water-side than air-side where possible (pump typically cheaper than fan). Avoid high fan speeds due to cubic power. Maintain static-pressure reset by keeping at least one zone damper at 100% open to reduce throttling.
4) Actuator adjustments:
   - OA damper: reduce moderately from 0.44 → 0.40 to cut ventilation load while keeping Z1/Z2 CO2 trending near-flat/slightly down (small change to avoid a rebound above 1000 ppm).
   - Fan speed: trim slightly 0.66 → 0.64 (≈−8.8% fan power via 0.66^3→0.64^3) to save energy without starving Z2.
   - Coil valve: nudge up 0.88 → 0.89 (≈+3.5% water flow; +3.5%^3 ≈ +3.5% in Q surrogate, +3.5% pump power, exact cubic 0.681→0.705 ≈ +3.4e-2 of P_pump_ref) to offset the small fan reduction and support Z2 cooling. Net effect slightly shifts load to the more efficient water side.
   - Zone dampers (redistribution with at least one wide open): keep Z2 at 1.0 (anchor for static pressure), reduce Z1 to 0.80 to avoid overcooling, slightly open Z3 to 0.65 and Z4 to 0.35 to address their warm tendencies.
5) Expected outcomes in next 5 minutes:
   - Z1: reduced flow + slightly colder SAT should arrest downward drift and move toward ~26.0 without overcooling.
   - Z2: colder SAT with max damper should begin gentle pull toward 26.0 despite a small fan reduction.
   - Z3: slight damper increase should hold near 26.2–26.3 trending toward 26.0.
   - Z4: added flow should stop the upward drift and hold near 26.1–26.2.
   - CO2: OA reduction (0.44→0.40) plus small fan decrease should leave Z2 ~steady to slightly down and keep Z1 ≤1000; Z3 and Z4 remain well below limits.
6) Power check (relative, normalized): Fan 0.66^3≈0.2875 → 0.64^3≈0.2621 (−8.8%). Pump 0.88^3≈0.6815 → 0.89^3≈0.7050 (+3.4%). Given pumps are typically more efficient than fans, this shift should reduce total electrical power while maintaining comfort and CO2 limits.
All values are within bounds and changes are smooth to avoid oscillation.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.8, 1.0, 0.65, 0.35], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.89, ""fan_speed"": 0.64}","{

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state: Z1=25.8°C (slightly cool, trending -0.01°C/min), CO2=1009 ppm rising 1.7 ppm/min; Z2=26.4°C (slightly warm, flat), CO2=1006 ppm rising 1.7 ppm/min; Z3=26.3°C, CO2=962 ppm rising slowly; Z4=26.2°C, CO2=825 ppm. Outdoor air is hot and humid (32.7°C), so extra OA increases coil load.
2) Constraints: Keep temps within 25–27°C (target 26°C). CO2 should be ≤1000 ppm and must never exceed 1050 ppm. Z1 and Z2 are already above 1000 ppm and trending up, so we need more ventilation now. Minimise energy: prefer increasing water-side (coil) over fan due to cubic power scaling and typical efficiency; keep OA as low as possible but increase enough to reverse CO2 rise. Maintain at least one zone damper fully open for static pressure minimisation.
3) Strategy: Increase OA fraction moderately to boost ventilation and drive Z1/Z2 CO2 downward; avoid increasing fan speed to limit cubic power penalty; slightly increase coil valve to offset the warmer mixed air from higher OA and nudge Z2 toward 26°C; adjust zone dampers to prioritise Z1/Z2 ventilation while trimming lower-priority zones (Z4 lowest CO2, Z3 acceptable) and keep at least one damper at 100%.
4) Actuator choices and rationale:
   - OA damper: 0.50 (from 0.35) to raise ventilation ~43% at same fan flow, aiming to turn Z1/Z2 CO2 slope negative while not over-ventilating.
   - Fan speed: hold at 0.64 to avoid the cubic fan power increase; added OA and damper prioritisation should address CO2.
   - Coil valve: 0.92 (from 0.88) to compensate for higher OA heat/humidity and keep temps near 26°C, especially cooling Z2 slightly; water-side increase is preferable energetically.
   - Zone dampers: [Z1 1.0, Z2 1.0, Z3 0.55, Z4 0.25]. Keep Z1/Z2 fully open for ventilation and static-pressure reset; trim Z3 slightly and Z4 more (low CO2, near setpoint) to direct available flow and reduce throttling losses.
5) Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes: Z1/Z2 CO2 trends should flatten or become negative and move toward ≤1000 ppm while staying well below 1050 ppm. Z2 should cool slightly toward 26°C; Z1 may cool marginally but should remain above 25°C; Z3 and Z4 remain within 25–27°C.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current states vs. constraints:
- Temperatures: All zones within 25–27°C. Z1=25.7 (slightly cool, drifting down), Z2–Z4=26.2 (slightly warm side but drifting down). Small reduction in cooling is acceptable to center near 26°C.
- CO2: Z1=1014 ppm and rising +8.3 ppm/min → would exceed 1050 within ~5 min if unchanged. Z2=984 ppm rising +5 ppm/min → likely to exceed 1000 soon. Z3=969 (+5.4), Z4=846 (+5.5). Immediate ventilation increase is required primarily for Z1 and preemptively for Z2.
2) Control strategy priorities:
- CO2 safety first: Increase delivered outdoor air to Z1 rapidly while minimizing total OA and avoiding large fan increases (cubic power). Most effective, low-power steps: increase OA fraction moderately and redistribute air via dampers so at least one zone damper is 100% open for static pressure reset.
- Temperature centering: Slightly reduce coil valve (chilled water) to avoid further overcooling and reduce pump power; warmer mixed air from higher OA also helps lift temperatures toward 26°C.
- Power minimization: Keep fan speed steady (avoid cubic penalty). Reduce coil valve modestly (pump power ~ cubic with valve position proxy). Increase OA only as much as needed to drive CO2 down.
3) Specific actions and rationale:
- Zone dampers: Open Z1 to 1.0 to maximize its ventilation and make it the wide-open zone for static-pressure reset. Slightly reduce Z2 from 1.0 to 0.95 to shift some flow toward Z1 while still supporting its CO2 near-limit. Keep Z3 at 0.60 (stable) and trim Z4 from 0.50 to 0.45 since it has ample CO2 margin and is a bit cool; this shifts more available flow to Z1 and reduces throttling losses.
- OA damper: Increase from 0.08 to 0.16. With Z1 at 1.0 and modest reductions elsewhere, this roughly 2x OA fraction—combined with more Z1 airflow—should reverse Z1’s CO2 slope and bring it below 1000 quickly, while also dropping Z2’s CO2.
- Coil valve: Reduce from 0.86 to 0.82 to ease cooling (prevent overcooling as OA rises) and cut pump power; warmer mixed air will help hold zones near 26°C.
- Fan speed: Hold at 0.60 to avoid cubic fan power increase; redistribution and OA increase address CO2 without needing more fan.
4) Constraints and anti-oscillation:
- All actuators within bounds; only moderate step changes except where CO2 limit risk necessitates stronger correction (OA, Z1 damper). Maintain at least one zone damper at 100% (Z1) for static pressure reset.
5) Expected outcomes next 5 minutes:
- CO2: Z1 should pivot from +8.3 ppm/min to a decreasing trend; Z2 should flatten or decrease; Z3 and Z4 should decrease due to higher OA fraction despite minor damper trims.
- Temperature: Slight warming from higher OA and lower coil should counter the slight downward drift, keeping all zones within 25–27°C and closer to 26°C.
6) Next-step plan (for future intervals): If all zones’ CO2 ≤ 980 ppm and falling, begin stepping OA back down toward minimum (e.g., -0.02 to -0.03 per interval) and consider a small fan reduction if at least one damper remains at 100% and others are >0.5. If Z1 CO2 remains >1000 or not clearly falling, increase OA to ~0.18 or slightly raise fan (+0.02) while keeping Z1 damper at 1.0.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.95, 0.6, 0.45], ""oa_damper"": 0.16, ""coil_valve"": 0.82, ""fan_speed"": 0.6}","{
  ""thought_process"": ""1) Assess current states vs. constraints:\n- Temperatures: All zones within 25–27°C. Z1=25.7 (slightly cool, drifting down), Z2–Z4=26.2 (slightly warm side but drifting down). Small reduction in cooling is acceptable to center near 26°C.\n- CO2: Z1=1014 ppm and rising +8.3 ppm/min → would exceed 1050 within ~5 min if unchanged. Z2=984 ppm rising +5 ppm/min → likely to exceed 1000 soon. Z3=969 (+5.4), Z4=846 (+5.5). Immediate ventilation increase is required primarily for Z1 and preemptively for Z2.\n2) Control strategy priorities:\n- CO2 safety first: Increase delivered outdoor air to Z1 rapidly while minimizing total OA and avoiding large fan increases (cubic power). Most effective, low-power steps: increase OA fraction moderately and redistribute air via dampers so at least one zone damper is 100% open for static pressure reset.\n- Temperature centering: Slightly reduce coil valve (chilled water) to avoid further overcooling and reduce pump power; warmer mixed air from higher OA also helps lift temperatures toward 26°C.\n- Power minimization: Keep fan speed steady (avoid cubic penalty). Reduce coil valve modestly (pump power ~ cubic with valve position proxy). Increase OA only as much as needed to drive CO2 down.\n3) Specific actions and rationale:\n- Zone dampers: Open Z1 to 1.0 to maximize its ventilation and make it the wide-open zone for static-pressure reset. Slightly reduce Z2 from 1.0 to 0.95 to shift some flow toward Z1 while still supporting its CO2 near-limit. Keep Z3 at 0.60 (stable) and trim Z4 from 0.50 to 0.45 since it has ample CO2 margin and is a bit cool; this shifts more available flow to Z1 and reduces throttling losses.\n- OA damper: Increase from 0.08 to 0.16. With Z1 at 1.0 and modest reductions elsewhere, this roughly 2x OA fraction—combined with more Z1 airflow—should reverse Z1’s CO2 slope and bring it below 1000 quickly, while also dropping Z2’s CO2.\n- Coil valve: Reduce from 0.86 to 0.82 to ease cooling (prevent overcooling as OA rises) and cut pump power; warmer mixed air will help hold zones near 26°C.\n- Fan speed: Hold at 0.60 to avoid cubic fan power increase; redistribution and OA increase address CO2 without needing more fan.\n4) Constraints and anti-oscillation:\n- All actuators within bounds; only moderate step changes except where CO2 limit risk necessitates stronger correction (OA, Z1 damper). Maintain at least one zone damper at 100% (Z1) for static pressure reset.\n5) Expected outcomes next 5 minutes:\n- CO2: Z1 should pivot from +8.3 ppm/min to a decreasing trend; Z2 should flatten or decrease; Z3 and Z4 should decrease due to higher OA fraction despite minor damper trims.\n- Temperature: Slight warming from higher OA and lower coil should counter the slight downward drift, keeping all zones within 25–27°C and closer to 26°C.\n6) Next-step plan (for future intervals): If all zones’ CO2 ≤ 980 ppm and falling, begin stepping OA back down toward minimum (e.g., -0.02 to -0.03 per interval) and consider a small fan reduction if at least one damper remains at 100% and others are >0.5.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current conditions vs constraints: All temps within 25–27°C and drifting slightly down (−0.01 to −0.02 °C/min). CO2 risk: Z1=1038 ppm rising +4.6 ppm/min → would reach ~1061 ppm in 5 min (violates 1050). Z2=1000 ppm rising +3 ppm/min → ~1015 ppm (>1000). Z3=988 ppm rising +3.7 ppm/min → ~1006.5 ppm (>1000). Z4 is safe. Outdoor air is hot/humid (32.7°C, high AH), so extra OA adds sensible/latent load; keep OA as low as possible while fixing CO2. 2) Control strategy prioritization: Prevent Z1 from ever exceeding 1050 and drive all zones toward ≤1000 ppm. For CO2, effective levers are OA fraction and total supply flow; redistributing zone dampers can direct OA to high-CO2 zones without large fan increases. Fan energy scales ~f^3, so avoid large fan increases; coil/pump adjustments do not help CO2 directly. 3) Actions chosen: - Increase OA damper moderately (0.16→0.30) to substantially boost OA fraction, reversing Z1’s rising trend and pulling Z2/Z3 below 1000 trajectory, while not going to extremes. - Slightly increase fan speed (0.60→0.62) for a small bump in total ventilation; cubic penalty is modest, and combined with OA increase should make Z1 trend non-positive within this interval. - Rebalance zone dampers to prioritize high-CO2 zones while keeping at least one damper fully open to minimize throttling: keep Z1 at 1.0; open Z2 to 1.0; open Z3 from 0.6→0.8; reduce Z4 from 0.45→0.35. This shifts more supply (and thus OA) to the problem zones without a large fan increase. - Keep coil valve at 0.82: current zone temps are slightly cooling; the warmer mixed air from more OA will offset that, keeping zones near 26°C without risking overcooling; avoids oscillation and maintains latent control given humid OA. 4) Expected outcomes next 5 min: Z1 CO2 trend should move from +4.6 ppm/min to ~0 or negative, staying well below 1050 and beginning to decline toward 1000; Z2/Z3 trends should go to ≲0 so they remain ≤1000; Z4 remains comfortable. Temps should hover near 26°C due to opposing effects (slight prior cooling trend vs higher OA load). 5) Bounds/smoothness: All changes within actuator limits and are smooth except the necessary OA increase to prevent a hard CO2 limit violation. Next step: if CO2 falls quickly, reduce OA toward minimum and/or fan speed to cut power; if still high in Z1, incrementally raise OA or fan a bit more, keeping dampers prioritized.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.8, 0.35], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.82, ""fan_speed"": 0.62}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

1) Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C. Trends show slight overcooling (-0.01°C/min) across all zones, so we can trim cooling to drift toward 26°C.

3) Energy trade-offs: First reduce coil valve (cheapest lever to trim sensible load and chiller/pump power). Leave fan speed steady to maintain current ventilation rate while Z1 CO2 falls below 1000. Keep OA damper unchanged for the same reason. Maintain at least one zone damper fully open for static-pressure efficiency; current settings already have two zones at 100%.
4) Actuator adjustments: Close coil valve slightly to reduce cooling. Keep fan speed and OA unchanged to ensure CO2 compliance. Keep zone dampers unchanged to avoid oscillations and preserve at least one at 100%.
5) Expected outcome (next ~5 min): Z1 CO2 drops below 1000 within ~1 minute. Zone temperatures drift slightly upward toward 26°C, staying well within 25–27°C.

Slightly open Zone 3 to reduce throttling; keep Zone 4 steady to avoid extra cooling. 5) Smoothness and limits: Apply modest changes from previous settings; all actuators remain within bounds. Expected outcome: CO2 stays ≤1000 ppm, temps hover near 26°C, and total electrical power drops due to lower OA, coil, and fan."",

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Comfort status: All zones are within 25–27°C. Z1=25.3 (cool), Z2=25.6 (slightly cool), Z3=25.6 (slightly cool), Z4=26.0 (on target). Temperature trends are ~flat, so we can slightly reduce cooling to drift toward 26°C.
2) CO2/ventilation: Z1=993 ppm is closest to the 1000 ppm target but trending down (-3.6 ppm/min) at the current OA fraction. Others are 954–955 and 841 ppm and dropping. To minimize risk of crossing 1000 ppm, avoid large OA reductions this interval. Note: lowering fan speed slightly will also lower absolute OA flow; keeping the OA damper fraction steady provides a safety buffer.
3) Energy strategy: Reduce cooling load and airflow modestly to save power while maintaining comfort and CO2. Per cubic laws: 
   - Fan: 0.56→0.54 reduces fan power by ≈(0.54/0.56)^3 ≈ 10%.
   - Coil/pump: 0.46→0.42 reduces pump power by ≈(0.42/0.46)^3 ≈ 24% and reduces chiller load.
   Prefer small, smooth changes to avoid oscillations.
4) Airflow distribution/static pressure: Keep at least one damper at 100% open to support static-pressure reset. Maintain Z1 at 1.0. Slightly open Z4 (was most throttled) to reduce throttling losses and improve distribution. Slightly throttle Z2/Z3 (they are a bit cool) to limit overcooling.
5) OA damper: Hold at 0.43 this interval because Z1 is near 1000 ppm; combined with a small fan reduction, this should keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm. We can consider trimming OA next interval if CO2 remains comfortably below 1000 with a non-rising trend.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Comfort assessment: All zones are within 25–27°C and slightly cool vs. 26°C setpoint (errors: Z1 -0.7, Z2 -0.4, Z3 -0.4, Z4 -0.1). Aim to let temperatures drift gently up toward 26°C. 2) CO2/ventilation: Highest CO2 is Zone 1 at 980 ppm with a negative trend (-2.4 ppm/min). Others are 829–952 ppm, also trending down. We can modestly reduce outdoor air to save energy but must keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm and avoid overshoot. Prioritize Zone 1 airflow by keeping its damper at 100% open. 3) Power trade-off: Fan and pump powers scale ~cube of commands. To reduce total power, first relax coil (less water flow/cooling), then trim fan speed slightly, while maintaining at least one fully open zone damper to minimize static pressure and throttling. Reducing OA fraction also reduces coil/chiller load. 4) Actuator strategy: - Coil_valve: decrease from 0.42 → 0.36 to reduce overcooling and pump/chiller power; allows zones to warm slightly toward 26°C. - Fan_speed: small decrease 0.54 → 0.50 to cut fan power (cube scaling) without causing comfort or CO2 issues; keep Z1 damper at 1.0 for static-pressure reset. - OA_damper: modest decrease 0.43 → 0.40 (about 7% fraction reduction).

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Summary of decisions: 1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C and trending slightly upward (~+0.05°C over 5 min for Z1–Z3). Leaving coil and fan largely unchanged keeps temps near 26°C while avoiding extra power. 2) CO2/ventilation: Z1 is at 1005 ppm and rising; Z2 and Z3 will approach/exceed 1000 ppm within the next interval if unchanged. To arrest and reverse CO2 rise with minimal energy, increase outdoor-air fraction moderately and redistribute airflow toward higher-CO2 zones, while keeping at least one damper fully open for low static pressure. 3) Power minimisation: Keep fan at minimum (cubic savings). Use OA increase just enough to meet CO2 needs and rely on damper redistribution rather than fan speed. Keep coil valve steady to avoid pump/chiller increases; the slightly warmer mixed air from higher OA helps nudge zones toward 26°C without leaving the comfort band. 4) Static-pressure logic: Maintain Zone 1 damper at 100% open; adjust other dampers smoothly. 5) Smooth changes: Apply moderate OA and damper adjustments to avoid oscillations. Expected outcome next 5 min: CO2 trends reduce across Z1–Z3 (targeting ≤1000 ppm without exceeding 1050), temperatures remain within 25–27°C and gravitate toward 26°C, with minimal increase in total power.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.8, 0.8, 0.4], ""oa_damper"": 0.33, ""coil_valve"": 0.3, ""fan_speed"": 0.45}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","1) Assess current state vs. objectives:
- Temps: Z1=25.4 (cool), Z2=25.7 (slightly cool), Z3=25.8 (near target), Z4=26.1 (slightly warm). All within 25–27°C; aim to drift toward 26°C.
- CO2 (limit ≤1000 ppm; hard cap 1050): Z1=994 (+0.6 ppm/min), Z2=973 (+1.2), Z3=984 (+1.3), Z4=842 (+1.1). Z1 is close to 1000 but trending slowly; others have margin.
- Outdoor air is hot/humid (30.8°C, high AH), so avoid increasing OA unless needed for CO2.

2) Energy trade-offs and priorities:
- Fan power scales with f^3 and dominates at current settings (0.55^3 ≈ 0.166). Pump/coil at 0.22^3 ≈ 0.0106 is small.
- To reduce power, prefer a small fan decrease (big savings) and a slight coil decrease (additional savings), but protect CO2 by not reducing OA fraction.
- Keep at least one zone damper at 100% open for static-pressure reset; use zone dampers to balance comfort before changing central setpoints.

3) OA damper decision (CO2 control):
- Z1 at 994 ppm with +0.6 ppm/min implies ~+3 ppm over 5 min to ~997 if conditions are similar. Reducing OA risks exceeding 1000. Increasing OA increases latent load. Decision: hold OA at 0.30 to maintain CO2 near but below 1000 while minimizing OA.

4) Zone damper adjustments (comfort distribution, static-pressure logic):
- Keep Z1 at 1.0 (fully open) to anchor static pressure and help ventilation in the highest-CO2 zone.
- Slightly throttle cooler zones Z2 and Z3 to reduce their cooling and shift some flow toward the warmer zone and Z1: Z2 from 0.65→0.60, Z3 from 0.65→0.62.
- Open Z4 a bit (0.35→0.40) to provide a touch more cooling to the slightly warm zone.
- These are smooth changes and preserve at least one damper at 100% open.

5) Coil valve and fan speed (power minimization with comfort/CO2 safeguarded):
- Coil valve: reduce slightly 0.22→0.20 to trim chiller/pump power and let cool zones drift toward 26°C. Pump power drops (~0.0106→~0.008).
- Fan speed: small reduction 0.55→0.53 saves ~10% fan power ((0.53/0.55)^3≈0.89). With OA fraction held and Z1 damper wide open, Z1 CO2 trend should remain ≤ about +0.7 ppm/min, projecting ~997–998 ppm at 5 min; other zones remain well below 1000.

6) Constraint check:
- Temps expected to drift slightly toward 26 (Z1/2/3 up a bit, Z4 stable to slightly up), staying within 25–27°C.
- CO2 projected ≤1000 ppm in all zones for the next 5 minutes; far from 1050.
- Smooth changes, all actuators within bounds, and one damper at 100% open.

7) Next-step contingency (implicit): If Z1 CO2 rises faster than expected, next interval increase OA slightly (e.g., +0.02–0.03) or restore fan by +0.01–0.02 while maintaining Z1 damper at 1.0.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.6, 0.62, 0.4], ""oa_damper"": 0.3, ""coil_valve"": 0.2, ""fan_speed"": 0.53}","{

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).

Choose actuator commands that keep all zones within 25–27°C (target 26°C), keep CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm (never exceed 1050 ppm), minimise outdoor-air intake, and minimise total electrical power P_total using the cubic scaling of fan/pump power described above.","Priorities this interval: keep all zones 25–27°C near 26°C, hold CO2 ≤1000 ppm (hard cap 1050), minimise OA and total power. Key observations: (1) Temps are all within band; Zone 1 is a bit cool (25.4), Zones 2–3 just below 26, Zone 4 slightly above (26.1). (2) CO2: Zone 3 is the tightest (996 ppm rising ~0.8 ppm/min), Zone 1 is high but drifting down, Zone 2 rising but with margin, Zone 4 low. (3) Energy: fan at 0.55 and coil at 0.18; OA at 0.32 with hot/humid outdoor air, so reducing OA helps coil/chiller. Control strategy: (a) Maintain static-pressure reset by keeping at least one damper at 100% and minimise throttling. Shift the wide-open damper from Zone 1 (which is cool) to Zone 3 to prioritise its ventilation/CO2, but keep Zone 1 fully open as well to avoid sudden CO2 rise there. (b) Slightly reduce OA fraction to lower latent/sensible load while compensating by fully opening Zone 3 damper to keep its CO2 in check. (c) Trim fan speed modestly to cut cubic fan power while preserving ventilation via the fully open dampers. (d) Hold coil valve steady to avoid oscillations; water-side is generally cheaper than fan, but current temps are good and OA reduction already eases coil load. Resulting setpoints: Zone dampers [1.0, 0.6, 1.0, 0.4] keep 2 dampers fully open (pressure reset), give Zone 3 max ventilation for CO2, maintain Zone 1 ventilation to avoid breaching 1000 ppm, slightly open Zone 2 to temper its CO2 rise, and hold Zone 4 steady. OA damper reduced slightly to 0.30 (from 0.32) to cut outdoor load without endangering CO2 because Zone 3 gets much higher flow. Fan speed reduced to 0.52 (from 0.55) for ~15% fan power reduction; with dampers wide open, ventilation to critical zones remains adequate. Coil valve held at 0.18 for stability. Expectation: Zones remain in 25–27°C, Zone 3 CO2 stabilises near/below 1000 ppm, Zone 1 stays ≤1000 ppm despite slight OA reduction, total power drops via fan and OA reduction.

You are a supervisory decision-making agent for a multi-zone VAV HVAC system. The controlled zones are: Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4. Select actuator setpoints every 5 minutes. The goal is to keep all zones comfortable while minimising electrical power. Follow these physics-based objectives and constraints:
- Comfort: target 26°C with an acceptable band of 25–27°C for every zone. Prefer values close to 26°C.
- CO2/ventilation: minimise outdoor-air intake while keeping each zone's CO2 ≤ 1000 ppm; it must never exceed 1050 ppm.
- Electrical power to minimise (use these relations for trade-offs):
    Fan power: P_fan ≈ P_fan_ref * (f/1.0)^3, where 'fan_speed' f is relative speed (1.0 = nominal).
    Pump power (water-side via coil): P_pump ≈ P_pump_ref * (w/1.0)^3, where w is proportional to water flow (use 'coil_valve' as a proxy).
    Typically η_pump > η_fan, so increasing water flow is usually cheaper than increasing fan speed for the same load.
    Total power to minimise: P_total = P_fan + P_pump (+ chiller/compressor if applicable). Reducing outdoor air also reduces coil/chiller power.
- Balance airflow vs. water flow for the same sensible load Q using a simple surrogate: Q ≈ k_air * f + k_water * w (k_air, k_water > 0).
  Because power scales cubically, avoid large fan increases; first use 'coil_valve' where possible, then fine-tune 'fan_speed' and zone dampers.
- Static-pressure reset logic: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open; minimising throttling loss lowers the required static pressure and reduces fan power.
- Operational rules: respect actuator bounds; keep OA at its minimum unless needed for CO2; avoid oscillations by using smooth changes unless a limit would be violated.

Zone 1 CO2 is above the 1000 ppm target and rising; others are below but trending up. Outdoor air is hot/humid, so avoid excessive OA that would add latent load with coil already at max. Strategy: 1) Boost ventilation modestly by increasing OA damper and slightly increasing fan speed to drive down Zone 1 CO2 and provide more cooling air. 2) Keep coil valve at 100% to handle the increased heat/moisture from added OA and maintain cooling capacity. 3) Maintain most zone dampers fully open to minimize throttling losses and satisfy the static-pressure reset requirement; only trim Zone 2 (slightly cool and trending cooler) to reduce overcooling while biasing airflow toward warmer zones.

Zone 1 CO2 is above the 1000 ppm target and rising; others are below but trending up. Outdoor air is hot/humid, so avoid excessive OA that would add latent load with coil already at max. Strategy: 1) Boost ventilation modestly by increasing OA damper and slightly increasing fan speed to drive down Zone 1 CO2 and provide more cooling air. 2) Keep coil valve at 100% to handle the increased heat/moisture from added OA and maintain cooling capacity. 3) Maintain most zone dampers fully open to minimize throttling losses and satisfy the static-pressure reset requirement; only trim Zone 2 (slightly cool and trending cooler) to reduce overcooling while biasing airflow toward warmer zones. Expected outcome: Zone 1 CO2 trends toward/under target without risking a violation, Zone 1/4 temps move closer to 26°C, energy impact limited by keeping throttling minimal while applying only a modest fan/OA increase."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Summary of reasoning:
- Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C band. Zones 1 and 4 are warm (26.4°C) but trending very slowly down; Zones 2 and 3 are near 26°C with slight cool bias risk in 2.
- CO2: Only Zone 1 is above the 1000 ppm target (1027 ppm) but trending down. Avoiding the 1100 ppm violation is priority; modestly increasing OA should improve decay without excessive energy penalty.
- Energy/plant limits: Coil is already high (0.96). Raising OA too much risks coil saturation and higher chiller/fan energy due to hot/humid OA. Keep at least one damper at 100% for static-pressure reset; use wide-open dampers on warm zones to minimize throttling losses and avoid increasing fan speed.
Actions chosen:
- Zone dampers: Keep Zone 1 and Zone 4 at 1.0 to favor cooling and static pressure reset. Hold Zone 2 at 0.3 to avoid overcooling while still providing ventilation. Slightly trim Zone 3 to 0.6 to prevent drift below setpoint.
- OA damper: Increase from 0.42 to 0.50 to accelerate CO2 reduction, targeting Zone 1, while balancing latent load.
- Fan speed: Hold at 0.72 to avoid additional fan power; two zones at 1.0 should keep static pressure requirement low.
- Coil valve: Nudge up to 0.98 to counter the warmer mixed air from higher OA and maintain cooling for Zones 1 and 4.
Expected outcome over 5 min: Zones 1 and 4 cool slightly toward 26°C; Zone 2 stays near 25.9–26.0°C; Zone 3 remains near 26.0°C. Zone 1 CO2 decays closer to 1000 ppm without risk of 1100 ppm violation, with minimal increase in energy versus prior state.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.5, ""coil_valve"": 0.98, ""fan_speed"": 0.72}","{

Actions chosen: (1) Set Zone 1 and Zone 3 dampers to 1.0 to prioritize CO2 control and act as critical zones; keep Zone 4 high (0.85) due to being warm; keep Zone 2 low (0.35) since it’s near setpoint. This maintains at least one damper fully open and reduces throttling. (2) Reduce OA damper from 0.40 to 0.35 to cut load while maintaining CO2 below 1000 ppm, supported by higher Zone 1/3 flow. (3) Reduce fan speed from 0.68 to 0.62 to save energy, leveraging fully open dampers to preserve zone flows.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Assess comfort and air quality: All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band but slightly warm vs the 26°C center (errors: Z1=+0.4, Z2=+0.3, Z3=+0.1, Z4=+0.4) and drifting up ~0.01°C/min, so modestly more cooling is needed. CO2: Z1 is slightly above target (1013 ppm) but decreasing (-0.9 ppm/min); Z2/Z3 below 1000 and decreasing; Z4 well below. 2) Outdoor air risk/cost: OA is very hot and humid (34.6°C, high AH). Increasing OA fraction would worsen mixed-air conditions and strain the coil, which is already at 0.94, while only marginally accelerating CO2 reduction. 3) Energy and plant state: Two zones were at 100% damper (Z1, Z3), indicating low static pressure and minimal throttling—good for fan power. To improve comfort without a big energy penalty, favor small fan increase and near-max coil to drop SAT and maintain dehumidification, while keeping at least one zone damper at 100% for static-pressure reset logic. 4) Zone airflow distribution: Keep Z1 at 100% (warmest and highest CO2). Slightly open Z2 to help bring it to 26.0. Trim Z3 a bit since it’s close to setpoint to reduce unnecessary flow. Keep Z4 high because it’s warm. 5) OA fraction: Hold at 0.50 to continue CO2 decline without adding heat/moisture load. 6) Coil and fan: Nudge coil to ~max (0.99) to increase cooling/dehumidification; modestly increase fan speed (0.68) to improve delivery without a large cubic power penalty. 7) Static-pressure reset: Ensure at least one damper at 1.00 (Z1), others mostly open to minimize throttling losses; this supports lower required static pressure for a given flow. 8) Bounds check: All commands within specified limits. Expected outcome next 5 min: small downward temp drift toward 26.0 in all zones, continued CO2 decline with Z1 trending closer to target, no OA-induced load spike, and controlled fan energy.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.65, 0.9, 0.95], ""oa_damper"": 0.5, ""coil_valve"": 0.99, ""fan_speed"": 0.68}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Key goals for the next 5 minutes: keep all zones within the 25–27°C comfort band (ideally trending toward 26°C center), keep CO2 below 1000 ppm without risking the 1100 ppm violation, and reduce energy (fan/chiller/pump). Observations: All zones are within band but slightly warm (26.1–26.5°C). Z1 CO2 is 1005 ppm but trending down at -1.6 ppm/min with 50% OA; others are <1000 and falling. Coil valve is nearly maxed (0.99), indicating high load; OA air is hot and humid (34°C, high AH), so ventilation load is significant. Strategy: reduce OA fraction to cut sensible/latent load while still allowing Z1 CO2 to drop below 1000 within 5 minutes; keep at least one zone damper fully open to allow lower static pressure and reduce fan energy; bias airflow to warmer zones (Z2, Z4) to nudge temperatures toward 26°C without increasing coil demand. Actions: set OA damper to 0.42 (≈16% less OA vs 0.5), which should keep Z1 CO2 trending down (approx -1.3 ppm/min → roughly 998 ppm after 5 min) while easing coil load; keep Z1 and open Z4 to 1.0 to ensure at least one damper is fully open and reduce throttling; slightly open Z2 to 0.75 to improve cooling; keep Z3 at 0.9. Slightly back off coil valve to 0.98 to save chiller energy given reduced OA load while still providing strong cooling.

Key observations: All zones within comfort band (26.2–26.5C). CO2: Z1 1010 ppm (slightly high, trending down), Z2 928 (+), Z3 957 (++), Z4 829 (-). Coil valve already high (0.97), OA air is hot/humid (33C, high AH), so avoid increasing OA fraction to prevent added latent/sensible load.
Strategy: Maintain OA fraction to avoid extra coil load; prioritize ventilation/airflow distribution to zones with rising CO2 by opening Z3 and moderately Z2; keep at least one damper at 1.0 (keep Z1 and Z3 at 1.0) to minimize throttling. With more open dampers, slightly trim fan speed to save power while preserving effective delivery. Keep coil near current to hold temperatures steady given hot/humid OA.
Expected outcome (next 5 min): CO2 in Z1 continues to decline below 1000; Z2/Z3 rises moderated by more airflow; temps remain within band; fan energy slightly reduced.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.9, 1.0, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.97, ""fan_speed"": 0.6}","{

CO2 in Z1 should flatten or begin to decline, staying below violation threshold with improved dilution; Z3’s approach to 1000 should slow or reverse. 5) Energy balance: Opening dampers to 100% minimizes throttling losses; modest fan increase trades some fan power for improved comfort and CO2 without a large OA increase.

Objectives/trade-offs: Priority is comfort around 26°C and avoiding any CO2 penalties while minimizing energy. Given comfort_sigma is tight (0.25°C), pushing cooler would improve comfort but increases fan/chiller energy; reducing OA risks CO2 penalties; reducing fan risks both comfort and CO2. Decision: Keep all zone dampers at 100% to minimize throttling and static pressure. Hold OA damper to maintain CO2 margin without adding latent load. Maintain coil valve and fan speed to keep zone temps steady within band and avoid extra energy use.

Expected outcome over 5 minutes: Slightly reduced airflow and coil should keep temperatures within 26.3–26.7°C (still in band) and keep CO2 < 1000 ppm, with lower fan/chiller power.

- Comfort: All zones are slightly above the 26°C center (26.3–26.6°C) but within the 25–27°C band; Zones 1 and 3 are drifting up ~0.05°C over the next 5 minutes. We want a small increase in sensible cooling without large energy cost.
- CO2: Zone 1 is at 996 ppm and trending up ~+6 ppm/5 min, likely to cross 1000 ppm if ventilation is unchanged. Others remain below 1000 ppm. Avoiding the target exceed reduces CO2 penalty while staying far from the 1100 ppm violation.
- Energy: Fan power rises roughly with the cube of speed; chiller load increases with more OA. To balance, slightly increase fan speed (boosts both cooling delivery and dilution) and only a modest OA fraction bump to keep Zone 1 under 1000 ppm while limiting latent load.
- Static pressure/reset: Keep all zone dampers at 100% open to minimize throttling losses and allow lower static pressure for a given flow.
- Chilled water valve: Already high (0.97). Keep it steady to maintain cold supply air without driving chiller load further.
Expected effect over next 5 minutes: modest temperature pull-down towards 26°C and reduced CO2 rise in Zone 1 so it stays at or below 1000 ppm, with limited increase in fan energy.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], ""oa_damper"": 0.47, ""coil_valve"": 0.97, ""fan_speed"": 0.64}","{

To nudge temps toward 26°C without adding throttling losses, increase airflow. 2) CO2: Zones 1 and 3 are slightly above the 1000 ppm target (1016/1006) but far from the 1100 ppm violation. Increasing total supply airflow at the same OA fraction will increase absolute OA cfm, helping CO2 without the full load penalty of raising OA%. 3) Energy: Keep zone dampers fully open to support static-pressure reset (minimize throttling and lower required static), and make the smallest effective fan increase to improve comfort and ventilation. Avoid increasing OA% given very hot/humid outdoor air which would raise coil load while coil is already maxed. 4) Constraints: Respect bounds, keep at least one damper at 100% (we keep all at 100%).

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Observations: All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band but slightly warm (~26.6°C in Z1–Z3). Z1 CO2 is 994 ppm and rising (~+12 ppm over next 5 min if unchanged), risking crossing the 1000 ppm target. Outdoor air is very hot/humid (35°C, high AH), so increasing OA too much raises load; coil is already at 100%. Strategy: Keep at least one damper fully open (Z1) for static-pressure reset.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives/priorities this interval: keep all zones within 25–27C centered at 26C, avoid CO2 >1000 ppm (and far from 1100 ppm violation), and minimize energy. Coil is already at max (1.0), so cold air capacity is constrained; any move that increases outdoor air fraction can warm mixed air and risk temperature drift. 2) Current state: All zones are within comfort band but slightly warm (26.2–26.6C) and essentially flat temperature trend. CO2 is at/above 1000 ppm in Zones 1–3 (Z1=1041 rising 1.3 ppm/min, Z3=1000 rising 1.5 ppm/min, Z2=1004 ~flat), Z4 lower (861). Outdoor air is hot/humid (35C, high AH), so large OA increases will add coil load. 3) Trade-offs: We need a modest OA increase to arrest CO2 rise in Z1–Z3 while avoiding significant mixed-air warming. Because the coil is maxed, we prefer to boost total airflow slightly (fan) and only modestly increase OA fraction. This increases OA volume for CO2 dilution with less mixed-air temperature penalty than a large OA fraction jump alone. 4) Static-pressure reset logic: Keep at least one damper fully open; opening high-CO2 zones fully reduces throttling losses and directs more flow to where ventilation is needed. We will keep Z1–Z3 at 100% and throttle Z4 (lowest CO2) to redistribute flow and reduce static losses. 5) Actions: - Zone dampers: Z1=1.0, Z2=1.0, Z3=1.0 (high CO2, prioritize ventilation/cooling), Z4=0.50 (lower CO2, slight throttle). This keeps multiple zones at 100% open for static pressure minimization. - OA damper: modest increase from 0.33 to 0.38 to add ventilation without excessive coil load. - Fan speed: increase from 0.80 to 0.85 to raise supply/ventilation volume and help cooling delivery even with coil maxed. Combined effect yields ~22% more OA cfm vs previous (0.85/0.80 * 0.38/0.33 ≈ 1.22) to curb CO2 rise while limiting mixed-air temp increase. - Coil valve: stay at 1.0 to maintain maximum dehumidification and cooling. 6) Expected outcome over 5 min: CO2 in Z1–Z3 should flatten or start decreasing, staying well below 1100 ppm.

  ""thought_process"": ""1) Objectives/priorities this interval: keep all zones within 25–27C centered at 26C, avoid CO2 >1000 ppm (and far from 1100 ppm violation), and minimize energy. Coil is already at max (1.0), so cold air capacity is constrained; any move that increases outdoor air fraction can warm mixed air and risk temperature drift. 2) Current state: All zones are within comfort band but slightly warm (26.2–26.6C) and essentially flat temperature trend. CO2 is at/above 1000 ppm in Zones 1–3 (Z1=1041 rising 1.3 ppm/min, Z3=1000 rising 1.5 ppm/min, Z2=1004 ~flat), Z4 lower (861). Outdoor air is hot/humid (35C, high AH), so large OA increases will add coil load. 3) Trade-offs: We need a modest OA increase to arrest CO2 rise in Z1–Z3 while avoiding significant mixed-air warming. Because the coil is maxed, we prefer to boost total airflow slightly (fan) and only modestly increase OA fraction. This increases OA volume for CO2 dilution with less mixed-air temperature penalty than a large OA fraction jump alone. 4) Static-pressure reset logic: Keep at least one damper fully open; opening high-CO2 zones fully reduces throttling losses and directs more flow to where ventilation is needed. We will keep Z1–Z3 at 100% and throttle Z4 (lowest CO2) to redistribute flow and reduce static losses. 5) Actions: - Zone dampers: Z1=1.0, Z2=1.0, Z3=1.0 (high CO2, prioritize ventilation/cooling), Z4=0.50 (lower CO2, slight throttle). This keeps multiple zones at 100% open for static pressure minimization. - OA damper: modest increase from 0.33 to 0.38 to add ventilation without excessive coil load. - Fan speed: increase from 0.80 to 0.85 to raise supply/ventilation volume and help cooling delivery even with coil maxed. Combined effect yields ~22% more OA cfm vs previous (0.85/0.80 * 0.38/0.33 ≈ 1.22) to curb CO2 rise while limiting mixed-air temp increase. - Coil valve: stay at 1.0 to maintain maximum dehumidification and cooling. 6) Expected outcome over 5 min: CO2 in Z1–Z3 should flatten or start decreasing, staying well below 1100 ppm. Temperatures should hold near current values or improve slightly due to higher cfm despite modest OA fraction increase. Energy impact: small fan power increase; damper strategy minimizes throttling losses, positioning for future fan speed reduction once CO2 stabilizes. 7) All commands clipped to bounds and maintain at least one damper at 100% open."",

Zone 4 is 26.2°C. We want a gentle pull toward 26°C without overshoot or excessive energy. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is 1029 ppm (above 1000 ppm target), trending down modestly; Zones 2–3 are ~990 ppm, Zone 4 is 860 ppm. We need to continue reducing CO2, especially in Zone 1, while avoiding an 1100+ ppm violation (not at risk now). 3) Plant/energy: Coil valve is already at 1.0 (max cooling) with hot outdoor air (35.1°C, humid). Raising OA too much would increase chiller load and risk warming SAT; however, some OA increase plus a small fan boost increases absolute OA CFM and sensible cooling delivered, helping CO2 and comfort. 4) Static pressure logic: Keep at least one VAV damper fully open; minimizing throttling reduces required static pressure and fan power. We will keep Zones 1–3 at 100% open and throttle Zone 4 (lowest need) to prevent overcooling. 5) Action choice: - Keep coil_valve at 1.0 to maximize cooling capacity. - Slightly increase fan_speed to 0.90 to raise delivered cooling and OA CFM. - Slightly increase oa_damper to 0.42 to accelerate CO2 reduction without a large load increase. - Set zone dampers [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.4]; Zones 1–3 fully open (critical, hotter, and higher CO2), Zone 4 partially closed to avoid overcooling. 6) Expected outcome over 5 minutes: modest temperature decrease (~0.1–0.2°C) in Zones 1–3 toward 26°C; continued CO2 reduction in Zone 1 (additional ~10–15 ppm drop vs current trend); Zone 4 remains near 26°C.

- Objectives: keep zones near 26 C (within 25–27 C), CO2 <1000 ppm, reduce fan/chiller energy; maintain at least one zone damper at 100% for static-pressure reset.
- Current state: All zones within comfort band but 0.3–0.5 C above setpoint; Zones 1–3 cooling slowly; Zone 4 warming slightly. CO2 near target (Zone 1 at 1004 ppm) but trending down in all zones. Outdoor air is hot/humid, so reducing OA fraction lowers latent load and chiller power.
- Strategy: Reduce fan speed and OA fraction moderately to cut energy while keeping CO2 trending downward. Keep cooling capacity high enough to prevent Zone 4 drift and continue slow pull-down toward 26 C. Maintain at least one damper fully open; prioritize flow to warmer zones and give Zone 4 more than before to stop its upward drift.
- Expected outcomes (next 5 min): CO2 continues to decline below 1000 ppm (Zone 1 drops ~10–20 ppm). Zone temps hold or edge slightly toward 26 C, staying well within 25–27 C.

Assessment: All zones are inside the comfort band (26.2–26.5 C) and drifting slightly cooler. CO2 is below 1000 ppm; only Zone 3 is slowly rising but still with ample margin. Outdoor air is hot and humid, so excess OA increases coil load. Strategy: 1) Use static-pressure reset by keeping at least one (preferably all) zone dampers fully open to reduce throttling losses and enable lower fan speed. 2) Reduce fan speed moderately to save cubic fan power while preserving comfort (since temperatures are already drifting down). 3) Trim OA fraction modestly to cut sensible/latent load yet keep CO2 below target. 4) Keep the cooling coil valve at 1.0 to maintain low SAT while we reduce airflow and OA, preventing any comfort/CO2 backslide.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Goals this interval: keep all zones within 25–27°C centered near 26°C, keep peak CO2 under 1000 ppm (avoid 1100 ppm violation), and minimize energy. Current status: Zones 1–3 are slightly warm (26.4–26.6°C), Zone 4 is on setpoint; CO2 in Zones 1 and 3 is near 1000 ppm but stable/down; outdoor air is very hot and humid, so economizing is undesirable. Strategy: maintain sufficient OA to keep CO2 <1000 without increasing load; hold at least one damper at 100% to satisfy static-pressure reset guidance; avoid fan increases to limit cubic fan power rise; use a slight coil increase to gently pull Zones 1–3 toward 26°C; fine-tune dampers to reduce throttling and balance loads. Actions: keep Zone 1 and 3 dampers at 1.0 (guarantee at least one fully open, lower throttling), slightly open Zone 2 damper to improve cooling/ventilation, slightly close Zone 4 to prevent overcooling; hold OA damper at 0.40 to keep CO2 below target without extra load; keep fan speed at 0.64 to avoid higher fan energy; nudge coil valve to 0.95 to trim temps by ~0.1–0.2°C. Expected outcome: Zones 1–3 drift modestly toward 26°C, Zone 4 stays near setpoint, peak CO2 remains just under 1000 ppm, and energy stays controlled.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.97, 1.0, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.95, ""fan_speed"": 0.64}","{

Zones 1 and 2 are slightly warm; Zone 4 is on setpoint. We need a modest cooling bump focused on hotter zones while avoiding overcooling Zone 4. (2) IAQ: CO2 in Zones 1 and 3 is close to 1000 ppm but trending down; to avoid risking a CO2 penalty, keep outside air at the prior level this interval. (3) Energy: Avoid fan speed increases (high cube-law penalty). Improve cooling efficacy by slightly increasing coil and reducing throttling—keep multiple dampers fully open and slightly trim only Zone 4. This maintains static-pressure reset (≥1 damper at 100%) with minimal throttling loss.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C band; Zone 3 is the warmest at 26.6°C but trending down (~0.05°C over 5 min). So only modest additional cooling/airflow is needed, prioritizing Zone 3. 2) CO2: Zones 1 and 3 exceed the 1000 ppm target (1027 and 1025 ppm) and are rising fast (≈8–10 ppm/min). Without action, they remain below the 1100 ppm violation in the next 5 minutes but incur ongoing CO2 penalty. 3) Ventilation vs energy: OA damper is very low (0.06). Increasing OA fraction is the most direct way to cut CO2. However, outdoor air is hot and humid (35.2°C, w=0.018), so we should raise OA moderately and avoid a big fan speed increase (fan power ~ speed^3). 4) Coil and fan: Coil valve is near max (0.95). Slightly increase it to offset the added OA load and protect supply air temperature; keep fan speed steady to limit power while dampers do more distribution work. 5) Static-pressure logic: Keep at least one damper fully open (Zone 3 at 1.0) to minimize throttling and support lower static needs. Open Zones 1 and 2 slightly to improve ventilation and cooling where CO2/temperature needs are higher; trim Zone 4 slightly (lowest CO2/load). 6) Net effect: Increase OA to reduce CO2 penalties without triggering a violation; maintain comfort with a small coil bump; avoid fan power spike.

1) Comfort: All zones are within 25–27°C; small cooling trends in Z1–Z3, slight warm trend in Z4. Keep temperatures near 26°C without risking overcooling or exceeding 27°C.
2) IAQ: CO2 >1000 ppm in Z1–Z3 (peaks 1058 ppm). Avoid approaching the 1100 ppm violation; reverse the rise in Z2 and accelerate dilution in all zones.
3) Strategy: Increase outdoor air fraction and slightly increase fan speed to boost ventilation quickly, while maintaining cooling capacity (coil at 1.0) due to hot, humid outdoor air. Use static pressure reset logic by keeping at least one damper fully open (set Z1–Z3 to 100%) to minimize throttling losses; modestly open Z4 for ventilation but avoid overcooling.
4) Energy: Changes are minimal and targeted—more OA and a small fan increase to reduce CO2 penalty and violation risk; keep coil at max for stability this hot hour; re-optimize down once CO2 drops.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Summary of rationale: All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band; Zone 3 is slightly warm (26.3°C) but trending down. CO2 is near the 1000 ppm target; Zone 1 is at 1011 ppm but decreasing quickly. To preserve comfort while reducing energy and ensuring CO2 drops below target, keep ventilation roughly steady this interval, reduce mechanical effort, and minimize throttling. Actions: (1) Keep outdoor-air damper at 0.45 so Zone 1’s CO2 continues to decline below 1000 ppm within the next 5 minutes. (2) Open most zone dampers fully to reduce static-pressure losses and keep at least one damper at 100%; leave Zone 4 slightly less open to avoid overcooling. (3) Lower fan speed moderately to cut fan power while maintaining sufficient ventilation. (4) Back off the cooling coil from fully open to reduce chiller load while keeping a gentle cooling trend for Zone 3. Plan: If CO2 falls comfortably below 1000 ppm next interval, begin trimming OA fraction further and consider additional fan/coil reductions while keeping at least one damper at 100%.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.45, ""coil_valve"": 0.85, ""fan_speed"": 0.75}","{

Small upward temperature trends suggest we should maintain or slightly increase cooling to hold near 26°C without overshooting. 2) CO2: Zones 1 (1012 ppm) and 2 (1003 ppm) are just over the 1000 ppm target and trending upward but well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold. We aim for a modest ventilation increase to curb the rise without large energy penalties. 3) Outdoor air is hot and humid (34.1°C, high absolute humidity), so large OA increases would raise coil load; prefer a small OA bump and avoid big fan increases. 4) Static-pressure strategy: keep at least one damper at 100% to minimize throttling; we will keep Zones 1–3 at 100% and hold Zone 4 partially closed to avoid overcooling there. 5) Actuator choices: - Zone dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5] keeps three zones fully open and limits cooling to cooler Zone 4. - OA damper: small increase from 0.34 to 0.36 to modestly boost ventilation and mitigate CO2 rise. - Coil valve: slight increase from 0.70 to 0.72 to offset added OA load and nudge temps toward 26°C. - Fan speed: hold at 0.57 to avoid extra fan power while the OA bump handles CO2.

Observations: Z1=26.1C/1015 ppm (CO2 trending down), Z2=26.3C/1008 ppm (down slightly), Z3=26.3C/976 ppm, Z4=25.9C/828 ppm (warming). Outdoor air is hot and humid (34C, high AH), so OA raises cooling/latent load. Prior action had three zones fully open, OA=0.4, coil=0.72, fan=0.57. Strategy: • Preserve static-pressure reset by keeping at least one (preferably several) zones at 100% open to minimize throttling. • Slightly restrict the coolest zone (Z4) to reduce overcooling and unnecessary airflow. • Modestly reduce OA fraction to trim latent/sensible load while keeping CO2 trending downward (avoid large reductions since Z1/Z2 are just above 1000 ppm). • Slightly reduce coil valve to save chiller energy while keeping temperatures within band; hold fan speed steady to preserve ventilation/mixing with slightly lower OA. Expected outcome next 5 min: temps remain well within 25-27C, CO2 in Z1/Z2 continues drifting toward 1000 (far from 1100 threshold), and total energy is reduced via lower OA and coil while maintaining multiple wide-open zones for low static pressure.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.3], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 0.7, ""fan_speed"": 0.57}","{

2) Assess IAQ and CO2 trends: Z1/Z2 at 1005 ppm rising 3.7/3.3 ppm/min -> +18.5/+16.5 ppm over 5 min to ~1023/1022 ppm (above 1000 target but well below 1100 violation). Z3/Z4 comfortably below 1000 ppm. We need modestly more outdoor air to trim the rise without incurring big latent load.
3) Energy considerations: Keep throttling losses low by holding at least one damper 100% open (preferably all). Fan power rises cubically with speed, so prioritize OA fraction and coil adjustments over fan increases. Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.8C, AH 0.019), so avoid excessive OA increases; compensate with coil to maintain supply air temperature.
4) Control strategy:

- Cooling coil: increase slightly (0.88 -> 0.93) to offset warmer, more humid mixed air and to prevent Z2 from reaching/exceeding 27C.
- Fan speed: hold at 0.58 to avoid cubic power increase; rely on coil and OA adjustments to meet comfort/IAQ for this 5-minute interval.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives: Keep zones within 25-27°C around 26°C, keep CO2 <1000 ppm, minimize energy, and ensure at least one damper is 100% open to reduce static pressure/fan power.
2) Current state: 
- Z2 at 27.0°C and rising (+0.02°C/min) risks leaving comfort band; needs more cooling/airflow.
- Z1 at 26.6°C and slowly rising; needs some cooling support.
- Z3 at 26.3°C stable; acceptable.
- Z4 at 25.9°C and slowly dropping; risk of overcool with more system capacity.
- CO2: Z1/Z2 at 1009 ppm and rising; Z3/Z4 are fine. Outdoor air is hot/humid (34°C, high AH), so OA increases cooling load.
3) Control strategy:
- Airflow distribution: Keep Z1-Z3 dampers fully open to minimize throttling losses and maximize delivery to warm/high-CO2 zones. Throttle only Z4 to protect it from overcooling while keeping at least one damper (actually three) at 100% to support static-pressure reset logic.
- Cooling capacity: Increase coil valve near max to lower SAT and quickly correct Z2 temperature. Comfort penalty is high, so short-term increased chiller load is justified.
- Ventilation/CO2: Modest OA increase plus a fan speed bump increases absolute OA flow to counteract CO2 rise in Z1/Z2 without excessive latent load.
- Fan: Moderate increase to boost supply and OA delivery; avoid excessive power while improving Z2 cooling and CO2 dilution.
4) Chosen setpoints:
- Zone dampers: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.55] keeps three zones wide open and trims Z4 to avoid overcool.
- OA damper: 0.50 (from 0.45) to improve CO2 without a large latent penalty.
- Coil valve: 1.00 to maximize cooling for Z2 and stabilize Z1; can back off once Z2 returns comfortably below 27°C.

Current trends suggest slow cooling: Z1 -0.01C/min, Z2 ~0C/min, Z3 -0.02C/min, Z4 ~0C/min. Without stronger delivery to hotter zones, Z2 risks lingering at/beyond 27C, incurring comfort penalty. 2) CO2: Z1=996ppm (+0.9/min), Z2=998ppm (+0.8/min), Z3=899ppm, Z4=764ppm. Z1 and Z2 will slightly exceed 1000ppm in ~5 minutes at current airflow. Violation threshold is 1100ppm (not imminent), but we should curb rise to reduce CO2 penalty. 3) Plant status/limits: Coil valve already at 1.0 (max). Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.5C, high AH). Raising OA fraction increases latent/sensible load and may warm supply air when coil is maxed; better to increase total airflow to improve both cooling and OA cfm without extra latent fraction. 4) Static-pressure reset intent: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open to minimize throttling. Keep the hottest zone (Z2) at 1.0; allow Z1 fairly open, and trim Z3/Z4 to avoid overcool while still avoiding excessive throttling. 5) Control moves: - Zone dampers: Z2=1.0 (hottest); Z1 moderately high (0.90) to continue cooling; Z3 moderate (0.75) since near target and trending down; Z4 low (0.30) since slightly below setpoint. This keeps at least one damper fully open. - Fan speed: increase from 0.68 to 0.74 to boost cooling capacity to Z2/Z1 and raise OA cfm (with same OA fraction) to slow/stop CO2 creep, balancing energy with comfort/CO2 penalties. - OA damper: hold at 0.35 to avoid extra latent/sensible load while coil is pinned; increased fan provides ~9% more OA cfm anyway. - Coil valve: remain at 1.0 to maximize sensible/latent removal given outdoor conditions. 6) Expected next-interval effects (~5 min): Z2 should drop below 27C (to ~26.6-26.8C); Z1 toward ~26.3-26.5C; Z3 ~26.1C; Z4 ~25.9-26.0C.

Violation threshold is 1100ppm (not imminent), but we should curb rise to reduce CO2 penalty. 3) Plant status/limits: Coil valve already at 1.0 (max). Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.5C, high AH). Raising OA fraction increases latent/sensible load and may warm supply air when coil is maxed; better to increase total airflow to improve both cooling and OA cfm without extra latent fraction. 4) Static-pressure reset intent: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open to minimize throttling. Keep the hottest zone (Z2) at 1.0; allow Z1 fairly open, and trim Z3/Z4 to avoid overcool while still avoiding excessive throttling. 5) Control moves: - Zone dampers: Z2=1.0 (hottest); Z1 moderately high (0.90) to continue cooling; Z3 moderate (0.75) since near target and trending down; Z4 low (0.30) since slightly below setpoint. This keeps at least one damper fully open. - Fan speed: increase from 0.68 to 0.74 to boost cooling capacity to Z2/Z1 and raise OA cfm (with same OA fraction) to slow/stop CO2 creep, balancing energy with comfort/CO2 penalties. - OA damper: hold at 0.35 to avoid extra latent/sensible load while coil is pinned; increased fan provides ~9% more OA cfm anyway. - Coil valve: remain at 1.0 to maximize sensible/latent removal given outdoor conditions. 6) Expected next-interval effects (~5 min): Z2 should drop below 27C (to ~26.6-26.8C); Z1 toward ~26.3-26.5C; Z3 ~26.1C; Z4 ~25.9-26.0C. CO2 in Z1/Z2 should stabilize near or slightly below 1000ppm due to higher OA cfm. Energy rises modestly from higher fan speed but is offset by reduced comfort/CO2 penalties."",

- Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C band; Zone 2 (26.7°C) is the warmest but trending down slightly. Zones 1,3 are trending a bit cool; avoid overcooling.
- CO2: Zones 1 and 2 are ~980–985 ppm and trending downward at current OA and airflow; keep them safely below 1000 ppm without excessive outside air.
- Energy: Reduce fan and coil where safe. Keep at least one zone damper at 100% open to enable static-pressure reset and minimize throttling losses.
- Damper strategy: Make Zone 2 the critical zone at 100% open. Trim airflow to Zones 1,3,4 to reduce overcooling and fan power.
- OA damper: Hold at 0.40 to maintain slight negative CO2 trend while avoiding additional latent/sensible load from hotter, humid outdoor air.
- Coil valve: Back off slightly from 1.0 to reduce chiller load while keeping Zone 2 within band.
- Fan speed: Nudge down from 0.74 to 0.72 to save fan energy while maintaining adequate ventilation and cooling with one damper fully open.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 1.0, 0.6, 0.3], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.9, ""fan_speed"": 0.72}","{

CO2 is below 1000 ppm in all zones and trending downward, so we can trim OA and airflow modestly to save energy without risking a violation. Actions: keep Zone 2 damper at 100% to satisfy static-pressure reset and allow a lower fan speed. Slightly throttle Zones 1 and 3 to avoid overcooling, open Zone 4 a bit to reduce throttling. Reduce coil and fan to cut chiller/fan energy while maintaining comfort. Maintain a moderate OA fraction to hold CO2 below target.

Current state: all zones within band and stable; Zone 1 CO2 at 991 ppm trending downward; outdoor is hot/humid, so excess OA raises cooling/latent load. Strategy: reduce fan to minimum to save significant fan power while keeping at least one zone damper at 100% open for static pressure reset. Compensate ventilation for the lower fan speed by modestly increasing OA damper to approximately maintain OA flow and avoid CO2 penalties.

  ""thought_process"": ""Objectives considered: keep all zones near 26 C within 25-27 C band, keep CO2 below 1000 ppm without triggering violation, and reduce energy (fan/chiller). Current state: all zones within band and stable; Zone 1 CO2 at 991 ppm trending downward; outdoor is hot/humid, so excess OA raises cooling/latent load. Strategy: reduce fan to minimum to save significant fan power while keeping at least one zone damper at 100% open for static pressure reset. Compensate ventilation for the lower fan speed by modestly increasing OA damper to approximately maintain OA flow and avoid CO2 penalties. Slightly relax coil valve to avoid overcooling while keeping temps near setpoint. Keep dampers generally open (one at 100%) to minimize throttling and support low static pressure.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Step 1: Comfort check. All zones are within the 25–27°C band. Zone 2 is slightly warm (26.2°C), Zones 1 and 3 are at 26.0°C, Zone 4 is slightly cool at 25.9°C. Temperature trends are flat, so small adjustments suffice.
Step 2: IAQ (CO2) check. All zones below 1000 ppm. Zone 1 is closest at 985 ppm but trending down (-0.4 ppm/min). Zone 3 is trending up slightly (+0.4 ppm/min) but still low (940 ppm). We must avoid pushing any zone over 1000 ppm; the violation penalty at 1100 ppm is large.
Step 3: Energy context. Outdoor air is hot/humid (31.1°C, AH 0.0164). Reducing OA fraction lowers coil load and energy. Fan is already at minimum (0.45), so hold it there. Coil at 0.56 is maintaining neutrality; with OA reduction we can likely hold coil steady without sacrificing comfort.
Step 4: Static-pressure strategy. Keep at least one zone damper at 100% open to minimize throttling and support low static/fan power. Prefer to fully open dampers for zones with higher temp/CO2 to aid comfort/IAQ.
Step 5: Actuator selection.
- Zone dampers: Keep Zones 1 and 2 at 1.0; open Zone 3 to 1.0 to assist its slight CO2 rise and share flow to the warmer zones; trim Zone 4 (coolest) slightly to 0.5 to redistribute air and avoid overcooling. This maintains at least one (actually three) dampers at 100%.
- OA damper: Reduce modestly from 0.45 to 0.38 to cut coil load while keeping CO2 below target, given we’re maintaining high supply to Zones 1–3. The 5-minute horizon and current CO2 margins make this low-risk.
- Coil valve: Hold at 0.56. With OA lowered and more flow to warmer zones, this should keep temps steady or nudge Zone 2 toward 26.0°C without risking drift above comfort band.
- Fan speed: Keep at minimum 0.45 to minimize energy while the wide-open dampers sustain airflow distribution.
Step 6: Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes. Zone 2 should drop slightly toward 26.1°C; Zones 1 and 3 remain near 26.0°C; Zone 4 nudges up toward 26.0°C. CO2 remains below 1000 ppm (Zone 1 near ~980–995, Zone 3 ~940–950). Energy use decreases due to lower OA and unchanged minimum fan.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.56, ""fan_speed"": 0.45}","{

Static-pressure strategy: keep at least one zone damper at 100% open to enable low duct static and minimize fan power; fan is already at its lower bound. Assessment: All zones are at ~26C with flat trends; RH is acceptable. CO2 is highest in Zone 1 at 997 ppm with a small upward trend; over the next 5 minutes it should remain under 1000 ppm. Outdoor air is hot and humid (30.8C, high absolute humidity), so increasing OA fraction would raise sensible/latent load and chiller energy for little near-term CO2 benefit. Action plan: Maintain three zones fully open to preserve low static pressure and efficient airflow; keep Zone 4 slightly throttled to avoid unnecessary flow while maintaining comfort. Hold OA damper at current value to avoid extra latent/sensible load given CO2 should remain below target in the next interval. Slightly trim coil valve to reduce chiller power while keeping temperatures within band.

Respect bounds: zone dampers 0.05-1.0, OA damper 0.05-1.0, coil 0.06-1.0, fan 0.45-1.4. 2) Current state snapshot: Z1=26.6C, Z2=26.1C, Z3=26.4C, Z4=26.7C. All trending down at -0.03 C/min with coil=0.60, fan=0.78. CO2: 705-838 ppm, rising 7.8-10 ppm/min. Outdoor 31.7C, hot and very humid; humidity rising. 3) 5-min forecast at current settings: Temperatures would drop ~0.15C (Z1≈26.45, Z2≈25.95, Z3≈26.25, Z4≈26.55), which is within band but slightly overcooling Zone 2 relative to center. CO2 would rise ~+39 to +50 ppm, staying <900 ppm. 4) Strategy: Reduce energy moderately while keeping zones near 26C and CO2 comfortably below 1000. Keep OA at minimum to avoid hot/humid air and latent load. Slightly reduce fan and coil to curtail overcooling, especially in Zone 2, and rebalance zone dampers to favor warmer zones (Z1, Z4) while trimming cooler Zone 2. 5) Chosen adjustments: - OA damper: hold at 0.05 (min) due to hot, humid outside; CO2 well below target. - Coil valve: reduce slightly to 0.55 (from 0.60) to avoid overcooling while maintaining dehumidification capacity. - Fan speed: reduce to 0.74 (from 0.78) for fan energy savings without sharply cutting ventilation/airflow. - Zone dampers: bias flow to warmer zones: Z1=0.90 (slightly reduced from 0.92), Z2=0.50 (down from 0.60), Z3=0.68 (slight trim), Z4=0.95 (slight trim from 0.98). 6) Expected 5-min outcomes: With modestly lower coil/fan and damper rebalance, zone cooling rates should ease from -0.03 to about -0.02 C/min on average: Z1≈26.5, Z2≈26.0, Z3≈26.3, Z4≈26.6 — centered near 26C and within comfort band. CO2 rise may increase slightly due to lower fan flow, but should remain <900 ppm across all zones; violation risk remains negligible. Energy: reduced fan cube law power and chilled water load, improving reward while keeping comfort and IAQ. 7) Bounds check and clipping: All selected values are within provided bounds; no clipping needed. 8) Next-interval plan: If any zone exceeds ~26.7C or CO2 rises >900 ppm, modestly increase fan to 0.78 and/or open relevant zone damper; if zones cool too much (<25.8C), further reduce coil to ~0.50 and slightly trim dampers in cooler zones.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 0.5, 0.68, 0.95], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.55, ""fan_speed"": 0.74}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Summary of reasoning for next 5 minutes: 1) Thermal: All zones are within the 25-27°C comfort band and trending slightly downward (-0.01 to -0.02 °C/min). Without changes, temperatures will stay near 26°C; we can modestly reduce cooling to save energy and avoid overcooling. 2) CO2: Zone 1 is highest at 935 ppm, rising ~9.2 ppm/min; projected ~981 ppm in 5 minutes, still below the 1000 ppm target and well below the 1100 ppm violation. Other zones remain comfortable margins below 1000 ppm. 3) Outdoor air: 32.3°C and humid (high latent load). Increasing OA would raise cooling/latent energy. Given CO2 projections remain under 1000 ppm, keep OA at minimum to minimize energy. 4) Controls strategy: Maintain fan speed to preserve current ventilation rate; slightly reduce coil valve to cut chiller load and slow the downward temperature trend; rebalance VAV dampers—slightly up for Zone 1 to improve local ventilation and slightly down for Zones 3 and 4 to trim cooling where warmer-than-setpoint but trending down, keep Zone 2 steady at setpoint. 5) Expected outcomes: All zones remain within band near 26°C; Zone 1 CO2 stays below 1000 ppm; reduced chiller energy with minimal fan energy change; OA remains at minimum to avoid latent penalties.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.94, 0.45, 0.58, 0.9], ""oa_damper"": 0.05, ""coil_valve"": 0.5, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Assess current state: All zones are within the 25-27 C comfort band with slight cooling trends (-0.01 to -0.02 C/min). CO2 is rising in all zones; Zone 1 at 979 ppm with +8.6 ppm/min is projected to exceed 1000 ppm within 5 minutes if ventilation is unchanged. Outdoor air is hot/humid (32.2 C, high AH), so increasing OA raises cooling/latent load. 2) Objective trade-offs: Avoid CO2 >1000 ppm (penalized at 0.5/ppm and big penalty at 1100), keep temps near 26, minimize power (weight 0.2). Since only Zone 1 risks crossing 1000, target a modest OA increase plus redistribute supply toward Zone 1 to boost its effective ventilation without a fan power increase. 3) Control strategy: - Increase OA damper moderately to reduce CO2 rise across all zones while limiting energy impact. - Bias zone dampers toward Zone 1 to further increase its ventilation and slightly pull back from Zone 4 and others (still comfortable). - Hold fan speed to avoid cubic fan energy increase; current temps are already trending down. - Slightly reduce coil valve to save chiller energy given temps are well within band and we are increasing OA; expect net temperature trends to remain near-flat or slightly cooling with redistributed airflow. 4) Predicted effects over next 5 minutes: With OA from 0.05 to ~0.12 (~2.4x OA) and Zone 1 damper slightly higher, Zone 1’s CO2 slope should drop from ~8.6 to ~3-4 ppm/min, keeping it near/below 1000 ppm by end of interval. Other zones remain well below 1000 ppm. Temperatures should stay within 25-27 C; Zone 1 likely remains near 26.1-26.3 C, others stable. 5) Energy considerations: Avoid increasing fan speed; slightly lower coil setpoint to offset added OA load and save energy, while maintaining comfort. 6) Constraints check: All actuators within bounds; values clipped if needed. 7) Next-interval plan: If Zone 1 CO2 still trends above target, consider a small additional OA or fan increase; if temps drift up, nudge coil back toward 0.50.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.98, 0.42, 0.55, 0.8], ""oa_damper"": 0.12, ""coil_valve"": 0.48, ""fan_speed"": 0.7}","{

Z3/Z4 also trending up. Choose a moderate OA increase to arrest/reverse CO2 rise without excessive latent load. - Comfort: Z4 slightly warm; increase its damper slightly to boost cooling. Z1 already max. Z3 needs a small boost to temper CO2 rise and hold near 26 C. Z2 is slightly cool; keep its damper steady to avoid further cooling while still providing ventilation. - Energy: Avoid large fan increases; a small fan bump improves delivery and ventilation while limiting fan energy. Increase coil valve moderately to offset the warmer/more humid OA and maintain supply air conditions. 4) Setpoints chosen: - Zone dampers: [Z1 1.0 (stay max to prioritize Z1 air), Z2 0.35 (hold to avoid overcool), Z3 0.7 (+0.05 to help CO2 and temps), Z4 0.85 (+0.05 to reduce its positive temp error)]. - OA damper: 0.32 (from 0.17) to meaningfully reduce CO2 trends, especially for Z1, while not maxing latent load. - Fan speed: 0.72 (slight increase from 0.7) to boost total ventilation and cooling distribution with modest energy cost. - Coil valve: 0.60 (from 0.50) to maintain SAT/dehumidification under higher OA and airflow, keeping zones within comfort. 5) Expected 5-min outcome: - Temps: Z1 ~26.0 C, Z3 ~26.0-26.05 C, Z4 pulled toward ~26.1-26.2 C; Z2 remains near 25.8-25.9 C (within band). - CO2: Z1 trend should shift toward neutral/slightly negative; other zones’ rises should slow, staying well below 1000 ppm and far from 1100 threshold. 6) Bounds: All commanded values clipped within provided limits.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.35, 0.7, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.32, ""coil_valve"": 0.6, ""fan_speed"": 0.72}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","High-level rationale:
1) Current state: All zones are too warm (28.3–28.6°C), trending down ~0.07–0.09°C/min. CO2 is low (456–504 ppm) with modest rise, well below 1000 ppm. Outdoor air is hotter and very humid (30.7°C, high AH), so bringing in more OA would increase sensible and latent load.
2) Objectives and constraints: Pull zone temps toward the 25–27°C comfort band quickly while keeping CO2 <1000 ppm and limiting energy. Given high humidity and heat outdoors, keep OA at minimum. Prioritize sensible/latent cooling via coil and airflow to the warmer zones. Respect actuator bounds.
3) Control strategy for next 5 minutes: 
- Keep OA damper at minimum to avoid moisture/heat (CO2 is safe).
- Max the cooling coil to deepen dehumidification and lower SAT for stronger sensible cooling.
- Keep zone VAV dampers near max, slightly favoring the warmest zones (1 and 4) to increase their flow share.
- Increase fan speed moderately above prior (1.25 -> 1.30) to boost heat removal without incurring the highest fan energy.
4) Expected outcome over 5 minutes: Cooling rate should improve to roughly ~0.10–0.11°C/min, dropping zones by ~0.5–0.55°C (remaining above band but moving closer, reducing comfort penalty). CO2 remains well <1000 ppm.

(2) Outdoor air is hotter and humid; CO2 indoors is low and rising slowly, so keep OA at minimum to avoid latent/sensible load and unnecessary energy. (3) Keep coil at max to hold low supply air temperature for fastest pull-down; slightly increase fan to boost sensible cooling this interval. (4) Bias airflow to the hotter zones (1 and 4) by slightly throttling 2 and 3; this improves balance without risking CO2.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C band and drifting slightly downward, so aggressive cooling is unnecessary. 2) IAQ: Zone 1 CO2 (975 ppm) is rising fastest and would likely exceed 1000 ppm within the next 5 minutes if we keep OA and flow unchanged; other zones remain comfortably below 1000 ppm. 3) Energy: To avoid a CO2 penalty with minimal energy impact, prioritize targeted airflow to Zone 1 and a small increase in outside air and fan speed.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Summary of reasoning: (1) Comfort: All zones are inside the 25–27°C band; Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.5°C), Zone 4 slightly warm (26.1°C). Small nudges should move zones closer to 26°C without overshoot. (2) CO2: All zones are below 1000 ppm; Zone 1 is the tightest at 990 ppm but trending downward. We can modestly reduce outside air to cut heat/moisture load while keeping CO2 safely under 1000 ppm. (3) Energy: Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.3°C, AH 0.0163), so OA reduction saves chiller/fan energy significantly. Minor fan and coil reductions should maintain comfort and CO2. (4) Actions: Reduce OA damper moderately (0.38→0.34) to save energy while keeping CO2 under target. Keep fan nearly steady with a small reduction (0.83→0.82) to retain ventilation effectiveness.

  ""thought_process"": ""Summary of reasoning: (1) Comfort: All zones are inside the 25–27°C band; Zone 1 is slightly cool (25.5°C), Zone 4 slightly warm (26.1°C). Small nudges should move zones closer to 26°C without overshoot. (2) CO2: All zones are below 1000 ppm; Zone 1 is the tightest at 990 ppm but trending downward. We can modestly reduce outside air to cut heat/moisture load while keeping CO2 safely under 1000 ppm. (3) Energy: Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.3°C, AH 0.0163), so OA reduction saves chiller/fan energy significantly. Minor fan and coil reductions should maintain comfort and CO2. (4) Actions: Reduce OA damper moderately (0.38→0.34) to save energy while keeping CO2 under target. Keep fan nearly steady with a small reduction (0.83→0.82) to retain ventilation effectiveness. Slightly reduce cooling valve (0.42→0.40) to bring Zone 1 up toward 26°C and avoid overcooling, while shifting airflow to Zone 4 to address its slight warmth. Maintain Zone 1 damper at max for ventilation; increase Zone 4 damper; slightly trim Zone 2 and 3 dampers to redistribute flow.

Zone 1 is closest (991 ppm) with a very small rise (+0.2 ppm/min). Zones 2–3 rising faster but still comfortably below 1000 in the next 5 minutes. To avoid future drift toward the target, we should not reduce overall ventilation significantly. 3) Outdoor conditions: Very hot and humid (33.8°C, AH 0.0163). To minimize latent/cooling load, avoid large outdoor air increases; however, a small OA adjustment may be justified to maintain CO2 margins given a planned reduction of Zone 1 airflow. 4) Strategy for the next 5 minutes: Shift airflow away from Zone 1 (to reduce overcooling) and toward Zone 4 (to counter its warming), with minor support to Zones 2–3 to stabilize. Keep coil and fan steady to avoid energy spikes while preserving comfort and CO2 control. Apply a slight OA increase to offset any CO2 rise from reducing Zone 1’s damper. 5) Actuator choices: - Zone dampers: Z1 from 1.0→0.80 to let it warm toward 26°C while still providing ventilation; Z4 from 0.68→0.78 for extra cooling; Z2 0.35→0.40 and Z3 0.50→0.52 to hold near setpoint and manage CO2 trends. - OA damper: 0.34→0.36 (small increase) to keep all zones safely below 1000 ppm despite redistribution. - Coil valve: hold at 0.40 to maintain current SAT and avoid overcooling/energy spike. - Fan speed: hold at 0.82 to maintain ventilation and avoid CO2 increases. 6) Expected outcome over 5 minutes: Zone 1 temperature nudges up toward 26°C without pushing CO2 over 1000; Zone 4 temperature nudges down or stabilizes; Zones 2–3 remain near setpoint.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Summary of reasoning (no step-by-step chain-of-thought):
- Thermal: All zones are within the 25–27°C band with a small warming trend (~+0.05°C over 5 min). Prioritize energy savings without leaving the comfort band. Avoid extra cooling just to hit 26.0 exactly.
- IAQ: CO2 is below 1000 ppm and trending downward; Zone 1 is the highest at 986 ppm. To avoid any risk of rising above target or violation penalties, keep outdoor air steady this interval and maintain adequate flow to Zones 1 and 3.
- Energy: Reduce fan speed modestly (largest energy lever) while keeping OA fraction constant to preserve IAQ. Slightly reduce coil valve to trim chiller load. Rebalance dampers: ease back on cooler/low-CO2 zones, keep higher flow where CO2 is highest (Z1) and where temperature is warmest (Z4).

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Objective: Keep all zones near 26°C (within 25–27°C), keep CO2 <1000 ppm, and minimize energy (fan/chiller/pump). Outdoor air is very hot/humid (34.6°C, high AH), so avoid unnecessary OA increases. CO2 violation penalty only triggers >1100 ppm; target is 1000 ppm with ongoing penalty above target.

5‑min projections at prior settings (for context):
- Zone 1: 25.8°C (−0.2°C from setpoint), warming +0.02°C/min → ~25.9°C; CO2 988 ppm rising +0.3/min → ~990–990.5 ppm (near target).
- Zone 2: 26.2°C, warming to ~26.3°C; CO2 ~939.5 ppm.
- Zone 3: 26.1°C, to ~26.2°C; CO2 ~960.5 ppm (slightly decreasing).
- Zone 4: 26.3°C, to ~26.4°C; CO2 ~850 ppm (decreasing).

Strategy for next 5 minutes:
- OA damper: Keep at 0.40. Zone 1 CO2 is close to 1000 ppm and trending up; reducing OA risks crossing target soon. Increasing OA would add significant heat/moisture load. Holding 0.40 balances CO2 control and energy.
- Fan speed: Hold at 0.75. Lowering would reduce ventilation and cooling, risking CO2 and comfort; raising increases power without clear benefit.
- Coil valve: Slightly increase from 0.36 → 0.38 to counter the upward temperature drift in Zones 2–4 while keeping energy reasonable and avoiding overcooling.
- Zone dampers: Rebalance airflow. Slightly reduce Zone 1 damper (still high to preserve ventilation) so it can warm toward 26°C, and open Zones 2–4 to arrest their upward drift toward 26.3–26.4°C.

Expected outcome:
- Zone 1 warms toward ~26.0°C with minimal CO2 impact (still below 1000 ppm).
- Zones 2–4 stabilize closer to 26.1–26.3°C instead of rising further.
- Energy kept moderate (no fan/OA increases; small coil bump only).

Z2–Z4 are slightly warm (26.2–26.4°C) and trending up; Z1 is at 25.9°C trending to ~26.0°C.

To avoid penalties and any risk of exceeding 1000 ppm, increase Z1’s relative supply and make a modest bump in OA fraction for added buffer, balancing energy. 3) Energy: Keep fan speed steady to maintain ventilation and avoid CO2 spikes; use a modest increase in coil for targeted temperature correction and shift dampers to favor warmer zones. This should minimize band penalties while keeping power reasonable. 4) Chosen actions: Slightly increase coil to enhance sensible cooling; open Z1 and Z4 dampers (warmest/co2-high), nudge Z2 up a bit, keep Z3 steady; small OA damper increase to add CO2 margin.

- Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C band; temps are slightly above 26°C but trending down (~0.05°C over next 5 min). Aim to maintain around 26°C without overcooling.
- CO2: Zones 1 (1017 ppm) and 3 (1012 ppm) are just above 1000 ppm but trending down. Avoid any change that would reverse this trend; keep ventilation sufficient to bring them just under 1000 ppm in the next 5 minutes.
- Energy: Outdoor air is hot and humid (33°C, high absolute humidity). Reducing OA fraction and modestly trimming fan/coil lowers latent/sensible load while keeping CO2 under control.
- Damper allocation: Keep high-flow to Zones 1 and 3 (highest CO2), maintain Zone 2 moderate, and trim Zone 4 slightly (lowest CO2) while still providing cooling since it’s at 26.6°C.
- Chosen adjustments: Slightly reduce OA (0.38) and fan (0.81) to save energy but preserve CO2 decline; slightly reduce coil (0.60) to avoid overcooling while maintaining gentle cooling.

- Comfort: All zones are within the 25–27°C band, but Zones 3 and 4 are warm (26.5–26.6°C). Pull them slightly toward 26°C to reduce comfort penalty (sigma=0.25 makes 0.5°C errors costly).
- IAQ: CO2 in Zones 1 and 3 is close to 1000 ppm but trending downward at current ventilation. Avoid reductions in ventilation that could push CO2 above target; violation risk outweighs small energy savings.
- Outdoor air is hot/humid (33.6°C, high AH), so avoid increasing OA to limit latent/sensible load.
- Energy: Prefer small, targeted adjustments (rebalancing zone dampers and modest coil increase) while keeping fan and OA steady to maintain CO2 downward trend and minimize extra power.
Actions chosen:
- Keep OA damper and fan speed unchanged to maintain IAQ and avoid fan energy increase.
- Slightly increase coil valve to provide a bit more cooling and dehumidification.
- Reallocate airflow via zone dampers: keep Zone 1 fully open to protect IAQ near 1000 ppm; increase Zones 2–4 dampers to cool the warmer zones, with priority to Zones 3 and 4.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.75, 0.95, 0.85], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.64, ""fan_speed"": 0.81}","{

Zone 1 CO2 is near the 1000 ppm target (991 ppm, slightly rising), while others are below and trending down. Outdoors is hot and humid (34.2°C, high absolute humidity), so we should avoid increasing the outside air fraction to limit latent/sensible load. Priorities for the next 5 minutes: keep CO2 under 1000 ppm (avoid violation risk), gently nudge temperatures downward toward 26°C center, and avoid unnecessary chiller energy. Strategy: (1) Slightly increase total airflow to improve sensible cooling and ventilation delivery; (2) Rebalance zone dampers toward warmer zones; (3) Keep coil valve steady to avoid extra chiller load while leveraging a bit more airflow for cooling; (4) Adjust OA damper to maintain approximately the same absolute OA flow as last interval despite a slightly higher fan speed, stabilizing CO2 without adding OA load. With fan from 0.74 to 0.78, setting OA damper to ~0.38 keeps OA flow roughly equal to before (mitigates CO2 rise in Zone 1). Expected outcome in 5 minutes: slight temperature reductions in Zones 2–4, Zone 1 holds near 26°C and CO2 stays below 1000 ppm; energy impact limited by keeping coil unchanged and only a modest fan increase.

CO2 is below 1000 ppm in all zones; Zone 2 shows a slight upward trend, others stable/down.

Expected outcomes (5 min): Zones 2 and 3 cool toward ~26.3–26.4°C; Zone 1 holds near ~26.2–26.3°C; Zone 4 stays ~26.3–26.5°C.

Zone 1 CO2 is 997 ppm and trending up slightly, close to the 1000 ppm target. Outdoor air is hot and humid (34.1°C, high absolute humidity), so large OA increases would raise chiller/latent load. Goal: nudge temperatures toward 26°C, keep CO2 under 1000 ppm, and avoid unnecessary energy spikes. Actions chosen: (1) Slightly increase OA fraction to curb the rising CO2 in Zone 1 without a large latent penalty. (2) Keep fan speed steady to avoid cubic fan power increases. (3) Modestly increase coil valve to bring zone temperatures gently toward 26°C and aid dehumidification against the higher-OA humidity. (4) Prioritize airflow to Zone 1 by fully opening its damper and trim Zone 4 (which is cooler and with low CO2) to rebalance flow without raising total fan. Zones 2 and 3 stay fully open to continue cooling and maintain low CO2.

Outdoor air is very hot/humid (34.9°C, high AH), so raising OA fraction will significantly increase cooling/latent load. 2) 5‑min projections if unchanged: Z1 could reach ~1047 ppm; Z2 ~1001; Z3 ~1001; Z4 ~863. No violation risk in 5 min, but Z1 penalty persists and others near 1000. 3) Control priorities for reward: Keep temps near 26°C (comfort penalty weight high), avoid CO2 exceeding 1000 and far from 1100 violation, minimize power (fan/chiller). 4) Strategy: Avoid increasing OA fraction (costly with hot/humid OA). Instead, increase total supply slightly (fan) and redistribute flow via zone dampers to deliver more ventilation/cooling to CO2/temperature constrained zones, especially Zone 1. Slightly reduce coil valve to offset the added fan flow while maintaining similar cooling capacity and saving some chiller energy. 5) Specific adjustments: - Zone dampers: Open Z1 to 1.0; keep Z3 high; slightly reduce Z2; reduce Z4 to shift capacity toward Z1–Z3. This increases Z1’s share by ~13% vs previous while modestly trimming Z4. - Fan speed: 0.85 (about +6% flow vs 0.8), boosting ventilation for all without the large chiller penalty of more OA fraction. - OA damper: Hold at 0.25 to limit additional heat/moisture load while the increased fan flow still raises absolute OA cfm. - Coil valve: Trim to 0.86 (from 0.88) to balance the higher airflow, aiming to keep zone temps near 26°C and reduce chiller power slightly. 6) Expected outcomes next 5 min: Z1 CO2 trend should flatten or reverse due to higher total and redistributed flow; Z2 and Z3 remain ≲1000 with the slight total flow increase and maintained/high dampers; Z4 remains well below 1000 despite reduced damper.

Risk of continued accumulation and eventual violation if we don’t increase outdoor air and delivery to high-CO2 zones. 3) Energy: Outdoor air is very hot/humid (35°C, high AH); increasing OA too much spikes coil/fan energy. Balance a moderate OA increase with a modest fan and coil bump to arrest CO2 rise while limiting power. Actions chosen: - Slightly increase OA fraction and fan to raise ventilation rate system-wide but avoid big energy step. - Nudge coil valve up to offset the added OA heat and improve sensible/latent removal. - Keep high damper positions for Zones 1–3 to prioritize cooling/ventilation where CO2 and temperature needs are greatest; keep Zone 4 moderate to maintain comfort without unnecessary ventilation.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Objective: keep all zones within 25-27 C, reduce CO2 toward/below 1000 ppm (avoid 1100 ppm), and minimize energy. Observations: All zones are within the temperature band but slightly warm (26.2-26.5 C) with mostly flat trends. CO2: Zone 1 is at 1010 ppm and rising; Zones 2 and 3 are in the high 900s and trending upward; Zone 4 is lower. Outdoor air is very hot and humid, so large OA increases are costly (cooling/latent load). Strategy for next 5 minutes: 1) Nudge ventilation up just enough to pull CO2 down, prioritizing minimal energy impact and avoiding excessive latent load. 2) Slightly rebalance zone dampers to favor Zones 1 and 3 (already at max) by trimming Zone 2 marginally; keep Zone 4 steady due to slight warming trend. 3) Slight increase to fan speed to boost total airflow (and thus OA mass) with a modest energy hit; limit OA damper increase to avoid large latent load. 4) Keep coil near previous level with a small bump to offset extra OA/airflow and hold temps near 26 C, avoiding overcooling. Actions chosen: keep Z1 and Z3 dampers at 1.0; trim Z2 damper to 0.9; keep Z4 at 0.45; increase OA damper moderately from 0.36 to 0.40; increase fan from 0.80 to 0.85; slightly increase coil from 0.87 to 0.88. Expected effect: modest CO2 reduction in Zones 1-3 without excessive energy/latent penalty; temperatures should remain within band and stable.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 0.9, 1.0, 0.45], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.88, ""fan_speed"": 0.85}","{

Strategy for next 5 minutes: Maintain ventilation for CO2 safety (especially Zone 1) while making small energy reductions that won’t jeopardize comfort. Actions: (a) Keep OA damper at 0.40 to avoid cutting ventilation to Zone 1 given its borderline CO2. (b) Slightly lower fan speed from 0.85 to 0.83 to trim energy with minimal ventilation reduction. (c) Rebalance zone dampers: keep Zone 1 damper at 1.00 to protect CO2 and temperature, slightly trim Zones 2 and 3 dampers to reduce load (they’re stable), and increase Zone 4 damper to boost cooling where it’s warming. (d) Nudge coil valve down a bit (0.88 -> 0.86) to modestly reduce chiller energy while remaining capable of gently pulling temps toward setpoint.

Current state: All zones are within band (26.2–26.6°C). Zone 4 is warmest at 26.6°C. CO2 is acceptable but tight in Zone 1 (994 ppm) with a slight downward trend; other zones are below 1000 ppm and trending down. Outdoor air is very hot (35.1°C), so increasing OA would raise cooling energy. Strategy: Maintain OA and fan to preserve CO2 margins while redistributing supply air toward warmer zones via terminal dampers. Avoid increasing coil/fan load given stable temps; prioritize slight comfort improvement without extra energy. Actions chosen: keep OA damper at 0.40 to hold CO2 decline; keep fan at 0.83 to avoid ventilation shortfall; keep coil valve at 0.86 to hold supply air temperature under high outdoor load; increase Zone 4 damper to deliver more cooling; keep Zone 1 damper fully open to protect CO2; nudge Zones 2 and 3 slightly up to maintain or gently lower temps. Expected outcome over 5 minutes: Zone 4 trends slightly cooler; Zones 2/3 hold or drift toward 26.2–26.3°C; Zone 1 CO2 remains below 1000 ppm with a small buffer; energy roughly unchanged from prior step.

Fan and coil are already moderately high; minimizing their changes reduces energy. 4) Strategy for reward: Keep plant-level loads steady (fan, coil, OA) to avoid energy penalties; reallocate supply air via zone dampers to prioritize the warmer/higher-CO2 zones (1 and 3), slightly trimming Zone 4 to free capacity. This should maintain comfort near 26 C and keep CO2 below target without extra energy. 5) Next-interval plan: If CO2 in Zones 1 or 3 approaches or exceeds ~995 ppm or temperature rises >0.2 C, consider a small OA increase (+0.02–0.04) or a minor fan bump (+0.02) on the next step; otherwise continue fine-tuning dampers.

- CO2 risk: Zones 1 and 3 are close to 1000 ppm (≈990–992) with slight upward trends. Avoid penalties by prioritizing ventilation to these zones while keeping total energy low.
- Outdoor air is very hot and humid (35.8°C, high absolute humidity). Avoid large OA increases that would raise coil load; make only a small OA adjustment and rebalance VAV dampers to the higher-CO2 zones.
- Energy: Slightly trim fan speed for savings while nudging OA fraction up so net OA flow doesn’t drop. Keep coil valve steady to maintain comfort under the small ventilation change.

Zone 1 CO2 is close to the 1000 ppm target but trending down; other zones are safely below 1000 ppm. To balance comfort and energy while protecting CO2, keep outdoor air fraction steady (hot/humid outdoors) and avoid increasing chiller/fan power. Redistribute airflow to favor the warmer zones (Zone 2 and Zone 3), maintain high airflow to Zone 1 to support CO2, and trim Zone 4 slightly (it’s cooling and has low CO2). Keep fan speed and coil valve steady to avoid unnecessary energy increase while nudging Zone 2 via damper position.

Z1 and Z4 are drifting down slowly (-0.01°C/min), Z2 and Z3 are flat. To improve comfort reward, we want a gentle push toward 26.0°C, especially for Z2 and Z3. 2) IAQ assessment: CO2 is near the 1000 ppm target: Z1 1016, Z2 1002, Z3 986, Z4 836 ppm. All zones are trending down at current settings. We are well below the 1100 ppm violation threshold; raising outdoor air would add significant heat/moisture given 34°C outdoors. Prefer to maintain OA fraction and bias airflow toward Z1/Z2 to assist their CO2 without increasing OA load. 3) Energy trade-off: Outdoor air is hot/humid; increasing OA would raise coil load and fan power. Fan power is cubic with speed; small increases are costly. Chilled water valve affects chiller load; we’ll seek minimal adjustments that improve comfort without large energy penalties. 4) Control strategy for next 5 minutes: - Keep OA damper at 0.36 to avoid extra latent/sensible load while CO2 remains trending down. - Slightly increase coil valve to 0.80 to provide a modest drop in supply air temperature so Z2/Z3 begin moving toward 26.0°C. - Keep fan at 0.66 to preserve current ventilation and cooling transport without incurring extra fan energy. - Reallocate zone airflow by keeping Z1/Z2 fully open (to aid both cooling and CO2 reduction) and trimming Z3/Z4 slightly to bias total flow toward Z1/Z2 while avoiding overcooling of Z4 (already drifting down). 5) Expected 5‑minute outcome: Z1 should cool slightly toward ~26.1°C with improved CO2 dilution; Z2 should begin to drift down from 26.4°C; Z3 should hold or inch down due to colder supply despite a slightly reduced damper; Z4 should hold near current temperature with reduced flow balancing the colder supply. CO2 in Z1/Z2 should continue trending down without increasing OA fraction, staying well below violation levels. This balances comfort improvement with restrained energy use.","{""zone_dampers"": [1.0, 1.0, 0.7, 0.45], ""oa_damper"": 0.36, ""coil_valve"": 0.8, ""fan_speed"": 0.66}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Objective: keep all zones in 25–27°C around 26°C, keep CO2 <1000 ppm, and cut energy.

CO2: Zones 1 and 2 are just above target (1009/1001 ppm) with slow increases; Zones 3 and 4 are below target. Outdoor air is hot and humid (34°C), so large OA increases are costly. Strategy for next 5 minutes: prioritize ventilation and cooling to Zones 1 and 2 by redistributing airflow via zone dampers, apply only a small OA increase to help pull CO2 back under 1000 ppm without a big coil load penalty, keep fan speed steady to avoid fan energy spikes, and trim coil slightly to reduce chiller load while maintaining comfort. Actions: - Zone dampers: keep Z1/Z2 at max; reduce Z3/Z4 to redirect flow to higher-CO2 zones. - OA damper: small bump to 0.34 to add a bit more dilution. - Coil: slight reduction to lower energy while keeping temp near 26°C. - Fan: hold steady.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Assessment: All zones are within the 25–27°C comfort band; Zones 2 and 3 are slightly warm (26.3°C) but not drifting up. CO2 in Zones 1–3 is near 1000 ppm but trending downward; Zone 4 is well below. Outdoor air is hot and humid (33.5°C, high absolute humidity), so excess OA raises cooling/latent load.
Strategy for next 5 minutes: Reduce energy while holding comfort and keeping CO2 below 1000 ppm. Trim OA moderately (not to minimum) to maintain slight CO2 decline, reduce coil and fan to cut chiller/fan power, and bias zone airflow toward Zones 2 and 3 to nudge them closer to 26.0°C without overcooling Zones 1 and 4.
Actuator choices:
- OA damper: Lower from 0.38 to 0.30 to cut hot/humid intake while maintaining adequate ventilation; expected to keep CO2 <1000 ppm over the interval.
- Coil valve: Reduce to 0.60 since less OA lowers mixed-air temperature and zones are already near setpoint; this trims chiller load while maintaining comfort.
- Fan speed: Reduce to 0.60 to save fan energy; ventilation remains adequate given OA=0.30 and short interval.
- Zone dampers: Shift flow distribution—Z1 0.85 (at setpoint), Z2 1.00 (slightly warm), Z3 0.75 (slightly warm, zero trend), Z4 0.35 (comfortable, low CO2).
Risk management: These settings preserve CO2 margin below 1000 ppm and keep zone temperatures centered near 26°C.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and constraints: Keep all zones within 25–27 C around 26 C, keep CO2 under 1000 ppm (avoid 1100 ppm violation penalty), and minimize energy. Actuator bounds: zone dampers [0.05, 1.0], OA damper [0.05, 1.0], coil valve [0.06, 1.0], fan speed [0.45, 1.4]. 2) Current state summary: Temperatures are within band but Zones 2–4 are drifting slightly up (+0.01 C/min), Zone 3 drifting slightly down. CO2 is problematic in Zones 1 (1025 ppm, +5.1 ppm/min) and 2 (1016 ppm, +4.4 ppm/min); Zone 3 is at 989 ppm (+0.7), Zone 4 at 844 ppm (+1.5). Outdoor air is hot and humid (33.5 C, high AH), so increasing OA raises cooling load. 3) Prior settings: OA damper 0.30, fan 0.60, coil 0.60; zone dampers [0.85, 1.00, 0.75, 0.35]. With these, Zones 1 and 2 CO2 are trending upward and could approach higher penalties over time. 4) Strategy: a) Increase total ventilation modestly to slow/reverse CO2 rise without large energy penalty: bump OA damper and a small fan increase. b) Reallocate supply toward Zones 1 and 2 to deliver a larger share of the OA flow to the highest-CO2 zones. c) Slightly increase cooling to offset warmer, humid OA and stabilize zone temps near 26 C. 5) Chosen adjustments: - OA damper: 0.40 (from 0.30) to raise OA ~33% while limiting latent load. - Fan speed: 0.65 (from 0.60) to increase total airflow and OA delivery (~8% more). - Coil valve: 0.65 (from 0.60) to hold temps as mixed air warms with more OA and afternoon load. - Zone dampers: increase Zones 1 and 2, trim Zones 3 and 4 to bias airflow/ventilation to where needed: [0.90, 1.00, 0.65, 0.30]. 6) Expected 5-min effect: - CO2: With ~44% higher OA flow overall (OA 0.30→0.40 and fan 0.60→0.65), Zones 1 and 2 CO2 rise should slow materially; peak CO2 should remain well below 1100 ppm and nudge closer to target (e.g., Zone 1 trending toward ~1010–1035 instead of ~1050 if unchanged). - Temperature: Slight cooling bias plus higher flow to Z1/Z2 should hold/trim Z2–Z4 by ~0.0–0.1 C and keep all zones near 26 C. 7) Bounds check: All commands within specified limits. 8) Trade-off: This balances the higher CO2 penalty weight (0.5) and violation risk against energy (0.2), using the minimum OA/fan increases likely to curb CO2 while maintaining comfort.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.9, 1.0, 0.65, 0.3], ""oa_damper"": 0.4, ""coil_valve"": 0.65, ""fan_speed"": 0.65}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Objective: keep all zones within 25–27 C around 26 C, CO2 below 1000 ppm, and minimize energy. Constraints: respect actuator bounds and plan for 5 minutes. Observations: Z2 (26.4 C) and Z4 (26.5 C, slightly rising) are warm; Z1 is 25.9 C; Z3 is 26.3 C. CO2 is near target: Z1 1005 ppm and Z2 1002 ppm trending slightly downward; Z3 965 ppm; Z4 841 ppm. Outdoor air is hot and humid (33.6 C, high AH), so increasing OA fraction would add sensible/latent load. Strategy: keep OA damper unchanged to avoid hurting CO2 while not increasing latent load; slightly increase cooling (coil valve) to lower supply-air temperature; redistribute airflow via zone dampers to prioritize warmer zones (Z2 and Z4) while trimming Z3; keep Z1 high for CO2. Maintain fan speed to avoid extra fan energy. Expected effects over 5 minutes: Z2 and Z4 cool modestly toward 26 C; Z1 stays within band and maintains CO2; Z3 remains comfortable; CO2 remains at or slightly below current levels without approaching violation threshold.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Step 1: Assess current comfort vs. target (26C, band 25-27C). Z1=25.9 (slightly cool), Z2=26.4, Z3=26.3, Z4=26.5. All within band; Z2/Z4 slightly warm, Z1 slightly cool. Temperature trends are near flat; Z4 has a small upward drift (+0.01C/min). Step 2: Assess IAQ. CO2: Z1=1004 ppm, Z2=1001 ppm (both ~target and trending down), Z3=965 ppm, Z4=840 ppm. No risk of violation (1100 ppm), but small penalties near 1000 ppm. Step 3: Outdoor conditions are hot and humid (33.8C, AH=0.019). Reducing outside air fraction lowers coil load and latent load; beneficial for power without jeopardizing CO2 if we stay near current ventilation efficacy. Step 4: Control strategy for next 5 minutes to maximize reward: - Slightly reduce OA damper to cut chiller/coil energy while keeping CO2 near target; maintain fan speed to preserve ventilation effectiveness. - Slightly reduce coil valve to avoid overcooling given lower mixed-air temperature and to save energy. - Keep Z1 and Z2 dampers high to protect IAQ where CO2 is near 1000; keep Z3 moderate; nudge Z4 up slightly to counter its small warming trend. - Hold fan speed to maintain stable airflow/ventilation while we reduce OA and coil. Step 5: Predicted effects over 5 minutes: - Temperatures remain within 25-27C: Z2 and Z4 should hold/edge slightly cooler with high damper positions; Z1 stays near 26C without further cooling due to slight coil reduction; Z3 steady. - CO2: With OA only slightly reduced and high dampers in Z1/Z2 plus steady fan, Z1 should drift to ~1002-1003 ppm and Z2 ~1000 ppm; Z3/Z4 remain well below target.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Objective: Keep all zones near 26C (25–27C band), keep CO2 <1000 ppm (avoid 1100 ppm violation), and minimize energy over the next 5 minutes.

State and short-term projections (5 min):
- Z1: 25.8C (slightly cool), CO2 975 ppm with near-flat trend (-0.2 ppm/min). Risk of drifting toward 1000 if ventilation drops. 
- Z2: 26.1C trending down ~0.1C to ~26.0; CO2 933 ppm decreasing fast. 
- Z3: 26.1C trending down ~0.05C to ~26.05; CO2 929 ppm decreasing. 
- Z4: 26.0C trending down ~0.05C to ~25.95; CO2 803 ppm stable/slightly rising but low.
- Outdoor is hot/humid (32.7C, high AH). More OA increases cooling/latent load and energy.

Control strategy:
- Ventilation/CO2: Z1 is near 1000 ppm; increase OA fraction slightly to strengthen dilution without large energy hit. Keep fan steady to avoid reducing total ventilation. Also shift more supply to Z1 by slightly opening its damper and trimming Z2/Z3, which are safely below 1000 ppm.
- Thermal/energy: Reduce coil slightly to offset added OA load and prevent overcooling (Z1 already a bit cool) while saving chiller energy. Keep fan at prior level to maintain ventilation effectiveness and avoid fan energy increase.

Chosen adjustments:
- OA damper: 0.40 (from 0.35) to improve CO2 margin, especially for Z1.
- Fan speed: 0.64 (hold) to maintain ventilation while avoiding fan energy increase.
- Coil valve: 0.62 (from 0.64) to modestly reduce cooling energy and avoid overcooling with higher OA.
- Zone dampers: Z1 up to 0.85 to boost dilution/cooling locally; Z2 down to 0.90 and Z3 down to 0.60 to keep them near setpoint and free flow for Z1; Z4 hold at 0.45 given temp and low CO2.

Expected outcomes over next 5 minutes:
- Z1 CO2 should dip below 975 and move away from 1000 due to higher OA and more zone flow; temperatures remain within band (slightly warmer SAT from coil reduction offsets added flow).
- Z2/Z3 temps hover near 26C with reduced dampers and slightly warmer SAT; CO2 remains well below 1000.
- Z4 remains within band with stable CO2.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Assess current comfort vs setpoint 26C: Z1=25.7C (slightly cool, stable), Z2=26.0C (on target, stable), Z3=26.1C (slightly warm, stable), Z4=26.0C (on target, stable). All within 25-27C comfort band.
2) Assess CO2 vs 1000 ppm target: Z1=959 ppm with a small upward trend (+0.5 ppm/min), others 790-912 ppm trending down. No violation risk; margin to 1100 ppm is large.
3) Outdoor is hot (32.3C) but cooling off. Reducing outside air fraction lowers cooling/dehumidification load and fan/chiller energy; must keep CO2 comfortably below target.
4) Energy strategy for next 5 minutes: modestly reduce fan speed and OA damper to cut energy while keeping CO2 <1000. Slightly lower coil valve due to reduced OA load. Adjust zone dampers to nudge Z1 slightly warmer (reduce its damper), give Z3 a touch more flow to pull it toward 26C, and trim Z2/Z4 dampers to save flow since they’re on target with low/rising ventilation margins.
5) Chosen adjustments:
   - Fan: 0.55 -> 0.50 (energy down, small impact on CO2/temps over 5 min).
   - OA damper: 0.40 -> 0.35 (about 20% less OA ventilation when combined with lower fan; still adequate to keep all zones <1000 ppm given current levels/trends).
   - Coil valve: hold slightly lower at 0.50 (reduced OA heat/moisture load offsets lower airflow; maintains comfort while saving chiller energy).
   - Zone dampers: Z1 0.75->0.72 (slightly reduce cooling; CO2 remains safe), Z2 0.72->0.65 (on-target temp and CO2 margin), Z3 0.65->0.68 (slight boost to reduce 26.1C toward 26C), Z4 0.45->0.40 (on target with ample CO2 margin).
6) Expected short-term outcome (5 min): Z1 temp drifts toward ~25.8-25.9C; Z3 nudges toward ~26.0C; Z2 and Z4 stay near 26C. CO2: Z1 may rise a few ppm (~962-965), others remain <950 and trending flat/down. All remain well below 1000 ppm and far from 1100 ppm violation. Energy use reduced across fan, coil, and OA conditioning.

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Objective: keep all zones within 25–27 C, keep CO2 under 1000 ppm (avoid 1100+), and minimize energy over the next 5 minutes.
Situation assessment:
- Temperatures: All zones are 25.8–26.1 C with very small warming rates; comfort is currently met and stable.
- CO2: Zone 1 is 994 ppm and trending up ~+7.5 ppm over 5 min, likely to clip 1000 ppm; other zones are comfortably below 1000 ppm.
- Outdoor air: Hot (31.8 C) and humid; increasing OA significantly would raise cooling load and humidity.
- Current actuators: Fan near minimum (0.46), coil moderate (0.43), OA at 0.37, Zone 1 damper already most open.
Control strategy for the next 5 minutes:
1) Prioritize preventing Zone 1 CO2 from crossing 1000 without large energy increases.
2) Use distribution first: slightly open Zone 1 damper and slightly trim others to bias more ventilation/cooling to Zone 1.
3) Make only a small OA increase to add dilution without a big load penalty.
4) Slightly reduce coil valve to save chiller energy, relying on stable zone temps and small redistribution; keep fan at current near-minimum to preserve ventilation while avoiding higher fan power.
Expected outcome:
- Zone 1 gets a bit more flow and slightly more OA dilution, likely flattening CO2 rise around the 1000 ppm target while keeping temperatures within 25–27 C.
- Energy use is contained (no fan increase, small coil reduction, modest OA bump).","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.56, 0.56, 0.28], ""oa_damper"": 0.39, ""coil_valve"": 0.41, ""fan_speed"": 0.46}","{

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","Step 1: Assess current state and trends.
- All zone temps are within the 25–27°C comfort band: Z1 25.9 (flat), Z2 26.2 (+0.01/min), Z3 26.1 (+0.01/min), Z4 26.3 (+0.01/min).
- CO2 is below 1000 ppm in all zones; Z1 is closest at 994 ppm and rising slowly (~+3–5 ppm over 5 min). Outdoor is hot/humid (31.2°C, AH 0.0163), so extra OA would increase cooling/latent load.

Step 2: Control priorities for next 5 minutes.
- Keep CO2 under 1000 ppm without triggering extra energy from higher OA or fan.
- Maintain temps near 26°C and safely within 25–27°C.
- Minimize energy: keep fan at minimum, modestly trim coil valve.

Step 3: Action rationale.
- Keep fan at minimum (0.45) to reduce power.
- Keep OA damper at 0.40 to avoid increased latent/cooling load while maintaining adequate ventilation overall.
- Slightly open Zone 1 damper to increase its share of supply/ventilation to counter its near-target CO2, with minimal energy impact. Keep others steady to maintain their temps.
- Slightly reduce coil valve from 0.39 to 0.36 to save chiller energy; predicted zone temps remain well within band given small warming and outdoor temp trending down.

Step 4: Predictions (5 minutes).
- Z1: temp ~25.85–25.95°C, CO2 ~990–1000 ppm (small improvement due to more supply).
- Z2: temp ~26.20–26.25°C, CO2 ~960–965 ppm.
- Z3: temp ~26.10–26.15°C, CO2 ~948–950 ppm.
- Z4: temp ~26.30–26.35°C, CO2 ~817–820 ppm.

Step 5: Bounds check.

Outdoor is hot/humid (31.2°C, AH 0.0163), so extra OA would increase cooling/latent load.\n\nStep 2: Control priorities for next 5 minutes.\n- Keep CO2 under 1000 ppm without triggering extra energy from higher OA or fan.\n- Maintain temps near 26°C and safely within 25–27°C.\n- Minimize energy: keep fan at minimum, modestly trim coil valve.\n\nStep 3: Action rationale.\n- Keep fan at minimum (0.45) to reduce power.\n- Keep OA damper at 0.40 to avoid increased latent/cooling load while maintaining adequate ventilation overall.\n- Slightly open Zone 1 damper to increase its share of supply/ventilation to counter its near-target CO2, with minimal energy impact. Keep others steady to maintain their temps.\n- Slightly reduce coil valve from 0.39 to 0.36 to save chiller energy; predicted zone temps remain well within band given small warming and outdoor temp trending down.\n\nStep 4: Predictions (5 minutes).\n- Z1: temp ~25.85–25.95°C, CO2 ~990–1000 ppm (small improvement due to more supply).\n- Z2: temp ~26.20–26.25°C, CO2 ~960–965 ppm.\n- Z3: temp ~26.10–26.15°C, CO2 ~948–950 ppm.\n- Z4: temp ~26.30–26.35°C, CO2 ~817–820 ppm.\n\nStep 5: Bounds check.\n- Zone dampers within [0.05, 1.0]; OA within [0.05, 1.0]; coil within [0.06, 1.0]; fan within [0.45, 1.4].\n\nStep 6: Expected reward impact.\n- Comfort maintained inside band, close to 26°C; CO2 maintained below 1000 ppm without risking violation; energy slightly reduced via coil trim and minimum fan."",

Select actuator commands that maximise the stated reward over the upcoming interval.","1) Objectives and constraints: Keep all zones within 25-27 C (center 26 C), keep peak CO2 < 1000 ppm (avoid 1100+ ppm violation), and reduce fan/chiller/pump energy. Respect bounds: zone dampers 0.05-1.0, OA damper 0.05-1.0, coil 0.06-1.0, fan 0.45-1.4.
2) Current state: All zones in band (26.0-26.3 C). Zone 1 CO2 is highest at 984 ppm with a slight upward drift; Zones 2-4 are ≤955 ppm and flat/down. Outdoor is hotter and more humid than indoors, so excess OA raises cooling/latent load.
3) Strategy for next 5 min: Slightly reduce energy while protecting CO2 margin. Keep temperatures near 26 C without overcooling. Rebalance zone dampers to favor Zone 1 (highest CO2) and trim low-need Zone 4. Slightly reduce OA fraction and fan to save energy, but not so much that CO2 approaches 1000 ppm. Maintain moderate coil to avoid warming past 27 C and to offset outdoor load.
4) Chosen adjustments: - Zone dampers: increase Zone 1 slightly; keep Zones 2/3 moderate; decrease Zone 4. - OA damper: slight reduction from 0.40 to 0.38 to cut latent/sensible load while keeping CO2 safe. - Fan: small reduction from 0.50 to 0.48 to save power while maintaining adequate ventilation. - Coil: slight reduction from 0.40 to 0.38 to reduce chiller energy while keeping temps stable.
5) Expected 5-min outcomes: Zone 1 receives a larger share of supply air, helping its CO2 and temperature hold near setpoint; CO2 peak should remain < 1000 ppm (Zone 1 ~985-990 ppm). Zone temperatures should remain within 26.0-26.4 C, well inside the comfort band. Energy use is reduced modestly via lower fan/coil and OA fraction.","{""zone_dampers"": [0.85, 0.82, 0.82, 0.64], ""oa_damper"": 0.38, ""coil_valve"": 0.38, ""fan_speed"": 0.48}","{
